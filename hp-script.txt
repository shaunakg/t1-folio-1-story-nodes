Doorstep Delivery
[It is nighttime in Surrey, we see an owl on the street sign "PRIVET DRIVE" and the camera pans to the street with very identical looking brown bricked houses. The owl flies away and an elderly man with crimson robes and a long silvery white beard named Albus Dumbledore walks out of a forest near the street, past a tabby cat standing next to what looks like a shed. He takes out his deluminator and activates it. Dumbledore zaps all the light out of the lampposts. He puts away the device and a cat meows. Dumbledore looks down at the cat.]
Dumbledore: I should have known that you would be here...Professor McGonagall.
[The cat silently looks at him, and the camera turns towards a wall. The cat's shadow turns into a woman with a tall hat. There are footsteps and Minerva McGonagall is revealed.]
McGonagall: Good evening, Professor Dumbledore. Are the rumors true, Albus?
Dumbledore: I'm afraid so, Professor. The good, and the bad
McGonagall: And the boy?
Dumbledore: Hagrid is bringing him.
McGonagall: Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?
Dumbledore: Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life.
[There is a motor sound, and the two professors look up to see a flying motorcycle coming down from the air. It skids on the street and halts. A large man with shoulder length black hair and beard named Rubeus Hagrid takes off his goggles.]
Hagrid: Professor Dumbledore, Sir. Professor McGonagall.
Dumbledore: No problems, I trust, Hagrid?
Hagrid: No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol. Heh. Try not to wake him. There you go.
[Hagrid hands a baby wrapped in a bundle over to Dumbledore.]
McGonagall: Albus, do you really think it's safe, leaving him with these people? I've watched them all day. They're the worst sort of Muggles imaginable. They really are...
Dumbledore: The only family he has.
[They stop outside a house which is 4 Privet Drive.]
McGonagall: This boy will be famous. There won't be a child in our world who doesn't know his name.
Dumbledore: Exactly. He's better off growing up away from all that. Until he is ready.
[Dumbledore places the baby on the ground slowly. Hagrid sniffles, he is sobbing a little. He clears his throat.]
Dumbledore: There, there, Hagrid. It's not really goodbye, after all.
[Hagrid nods. Dumbledore takes a letter and places it on the baby, who is now at the foot of the door.]
Dumbledore: Good luck...Harry Potter.
[The baby has a lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead. The camera slowly zooms towards the scar which glows brightly and it immediately flashes, transitioning to a stormy cloud sky. The film's title in metallic gold zooms out around the camera, and lightning flashes to brighten it up. Then, the lightning flashes engulf the screen, transitioning it to the present time.]

The Vanishing Glass
[The scar's glow immediately dies down, and the camera pans to see Harry who is now 10 years old, still sleeping. Then, the light turns on outside his bedroom cupboard under the stairs]

Petunia: Up. Get up. [She knocks on his closet door repeatedly] Now! [Smacks door of closet and walks into the living room]
[Harry wakes up, turns on his bedroom light and puts on his glasses with tape on the bridge, indicating that it was partly damaged. A large, tubby boy, Dudley Dursley, suddenly comes running down the stairs above the closet. He stops half-way down and goes back, jumping on the staircase.]
Dudley: Wake up, cousin! We're going to the zoo!
[Harry looks up to the join works of the stairs with small amounts of dusts rising. Dudley laughs, comes down the stairs and runs for the kitchen. Harry tries to come out of the closet, but is pushed back in by Dudley. Petunia is in the kitchen, where Dudley has gone.]
Petunia: Oh, here he comes, the birthday boy!
Vernon: Happy birthday, son.
[Petunia and Dudley giggle together. Harry comes into the kitchen, dressed in outgrown clothes.]
Petunia: [to Harry, unpleasantly] Why don't you just cook the breakfast, and try not to burn anything.
Harry: Yes, Aunt Petunia.
[Harry then gets to work on cooking the bacon]
Petunia: I want everything to be perfect for my Dudley's special day.
Vernon: [to Harry, who is taking his time placing the bacon on the plates] Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy!
Harry: Yes, Uncle Vernon.
[Petunia leads Dudley over to the family room, where there are a vast amount of presents. Dudley stares.]
Petunia: Aren’t they wonderful, darling?
Dudley: How many are there?
Vernon: Thirty-six. Counted 'em myself.
Dudley: Thirty-six?! But last year last year I had thirty-seven!!
Vernon: Err yes, well, some of them are quite a bit bigger than last year.
Dudley: I don't care how big they are!
Petunia: [calming him down] Oh, now, now, now. This is what we're going to do, is that when we go out, we're going to buy you two new presents! How's that, pumpkin?
[Outside the house morning. The happy family is heading to the car.]
Petunia: This will be a lovely day at the zoo. I'm really looking forward to it.
[Harry then goes to go in the car, but Vernon stops him, pointing his keys at him.]
Vernon: I'm warning you now, boy. Any funny business, any at all, and you won't have any meals for a week. Get in.
[At the London Zoo. The family is in the reptile house, looking at a large Boa constructor.]
Dudley: Make it move.
[Vernon taps the glass of the cage.]
Vernon: Move!
[Dudley taps the glass much harder, and Vernon nervously winces.]
Dudley: MOVE!
Harry: He's asleep!
Dudley: He's boring.
[Dudley and his parents head over to another enclosure. Harry is left with the snake.]
Harry: Sorry about him. He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day, having people press their ugly faces in on you. [The snake looks up and blinks.] Can you...hear me? [The snake nods] It's just...I've never talked to a snake before. Do you...I mean...do you talk to people often? [The snake shakes its head] You're from Burma, aren't you? Was it nice there, do you miss your family? [The snake turns its head in the direction of a sign which says, Bred in Captivity] I see. That's me as well. I never knew my parents, either.
[The now awake snake has attracted Dudley's attention. He comes over to the glass, knocking Harry to the floor.]

Dudley: Mommy, dad, come here! You won't believe what this snake is doing!
[Dudley puts his hands on the glass wall. With his back turned, Harry glares at him. Suddenly, the glass disappears, causing Dudley to wretch forward, losing his balance.]
Dudley: Whoa! Ahh! Ahh!!
[Dudley falls into the snake enclosure, sputtering in a pool of water. Harry snickers at what he saw. The snake gets out of the exhibit, stopping in front of Harry.]

Snake: Thanks.
Harry: Anytime.
[The snake slivers off to the exit.]
Man: SNAKE!
[There is a lot of screaming as the snake heads for freedom. Dudley gets up to get out, but the glass is now back over the enclosure. Seeing that he is now trapped, he pounds the glass in panic.]
Dudley: Mom, mommy!
Petunia: [notices him in the exhibit] AHH!
Dudley: Mom, help! Help me!
Petunia: My darling boy! How did you get in there?! How did you get in there? Dudley, oh, Dudley!
[Harry grins and snickers, Vernon notices this and glares down at him. Harry's grin disappears, knowing that he is in trouble with Vernon.]
Letters from No One
[Back at the Dursleys'. Petunia and a bundled up Dudley come in.]
Petunia: [assuring a distressed Dudley] It's all right, sweetheart. It's all right.
[They walk in the living room. Harry and Vernon enter. Vernon slams the door and shoves Harry against a wall, taking his hair.]
Harry: Ow!
Vernon: What happened?!
Harry: I swear I don't know! [Vernon snarls] One minute, the glass was there and then it was gone! It was like magic!
[Vernon scoffs at this, shoves Harry in the cupboard under the stairs and slams the door]
Vernon: There's no such thing as magic! [he blackens out the vent on the door]
[An owl flies into view and lands itself on a TV aerial on one of the houses' roof]
(Extended Version)
[The camera slowly pans up to reveal Dudley in his smartest school uniform, posing and smiling grandly.]

Petunia: Awww, smile. [She takes a photograph of him. She gasps in joy.] Vernon, just look at him. I can't believe it. In just a week you'll be off to Smeltings.
Vernon: Caveat Smeltona. Proudest moment of my life.
Harry: Will I have to wear that, too?
[They draw their attention to Harry]

Petunia: What, you? Go to Smeltings? [Harry nods, questionably]
Vernon: Ha!
[They laugh in amusement]

Petunia: Oh, don't be so stupid, you're going to the state school where you belong. [Goes to the kitchen and fishes out a grey shirt in a boiler.] And this is what you're gonna be wearing when I've finished dyeing it.
Harry: But that's Dudley's old uniform. It'll fit me like bits of old Elephant skin.
Petunia: It'll fit you well enough. Go get the post. [Harry then heads to the hallway] Go!
(Normal Version)
[Harry leaves the living room area into the hallway and picks up some letters, one of which had his name on it with his address of where he slept. Uncle Vernon and Dudley sit at the table while Aunt Petunia is busy fixing breakfast. Harry walks in with the mail and hands it to Uncle Vernon, then walks to his seat with his letter.]

Vernon: [after reading a postcard] Oh, Marge is ill! Ate a funny whelk.
[Dudley suddenly notices Harry's letter and runs to grab it from him and give it to his father.]

Dudley: Dad! Look! Harry's got a letter!
Harry: Hey, give it back! It's mine!
Vernon: Yours? Who'd be writing to you?
[The family gathers to look at the address. There is a broken seal on the letter. The family looks up and Harry gulps. Much later, another owl flies by with a letter and drops it off. Inside, Vernon grabs a handful of letters and rips them up. In the closet, Harry hears a whirring noise. He looks out at Vernon drilling wood over the letterbox opening.]

Vernon: No more mail through this letterbox.
[Harry quietly closes the cupboard door. The next day, Vernon and Petunia are outside the door. Vernon is about to head off to work. Petunia kisses his cheek.]

Petunia: Have a lovely day at the office, dear.
[She stops, looks and sees a bunch of owls.]

Vernon: Shoo! Go on!
[She notices something and pats Vernon on the shoulder to get his attention, and what they see is more letters addressed to Harry.]
(Extended Version)
[Later, Petunia is cracking a egg into a bowl, and what instead comes out is a folded-up letter. She cracks another one, but another letter comes out as well. She then cracks yet another one, but the same happens again. She stares at the letter, and then she hears the owls screeching. She draws her attention to the outside of the window, and what she sees is four owls sitting on some garden chairs. Petunia then screams and runs off.]
(Normal Version)
[Much later, Vernon is tossing letters into the fireplace. Harry comes around the corner. Vernon grins evilly and tosses more in. The scene fades to the next day, the family is sitting around, Harry is serving cookies.]

Vernon: Fine day Sunday. In my opinion, best day of the week. Why is that, Dudley?
Harry: [when Dudley shrugs and didn't answer, as Harry hands a cookie to Vernon] Because there's no post on Sunday?
Vernon: Ah, right you are, Harry. No post on Sunday. Ha! No blasted letters today. No, sir. Not one single bloody letter, not one. [Harry sees a shadow outside the window. Outside, millions of owls are perched.] No, sir, not one blasted, miserable-
[As Vernon was talking, a letter shoots out of the fireplace and zips across Vernon's face, cutting him off. There is a rumbling and then millions of letters come shooting out of the fireplace. The family shrieks in horror as Harry watches in amazement.]

Dudley: AHH! Make it stop! Please make it stop! [He jumps on Petunia's lap as she and Vernon continue screaming]
Vernon: Go away, ahh!
Dudley: What is it? Please tell me what's happening!
[Harry jumps onto the coffee table to grab a letter. He gets one and starts to run away. Vernon jumps up as well.]

Vernon: Give me that! Give me that letter!
[He chases Harry and grabs him before Harry gets into his closet.]

Harry: Get off! Ahh!
[Vernon restrains Harry as several letters begin to shoot everywhere around the house.]

Vernon: Ahh!
Harry: They're my letters! Let go of me!
[The wood plank nailed in front of the letterbox finally breaks from the excess pressure of the letters shooting through the letter.]

Vernon: That's it! We're going away! Far away! Where they can't find us!
Dudley: Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?!
[Petunia watches with a horrified look on her face, knowing that Dudley may be right.]

Keeper of the Keys
[That stormy night, a tall house, on a rock island somewhere out at sea. The Dursleys, including Harry have moved there, due to the chaos with the letters. The family is sleeping, with Harry on the cold, dirt floor and Dudley sleeping on a sofa. Harry has drawn a birthday cake which reads, Happy Birthday Harry. Harry looks at Dudley's watch, which beeps 12:00.]

Harry: [to himself] Make a wish, Harry. [he blows the "candles" on the drawn birthday cake]
[Suddenly, the door thumps, in sync with the thunder flashing. Harry jumps. The door thumps again and Dudley and Harry jump up and back away. Harry hides behind a wall, and Dudley cowers on a windowsill. Petunia and Vernon appear, with Vernon holding a double barrel gun.]

Vernon: Who's there? Ahh!
[The door bangs again and then falls down, and a giant man appears. As he comes into the clear lighting, he is revealed to be Hagrid.]

Hagrid: Sorry 'about that. [He puts the door back up]
Vernon: [aiming his gun at him] I demand that you leave at once, sir! You are breaking an entering!
[As Petunia quietly gasps in fear, Hagrid grabs the gun and bends it upwards.]

Hagrid: Dry up, Dursley, you great prune. [The gun fires upwards, blasting a hole in the ceiling, causing the two to shriek in fear. Hagrid notices Dudley.] Boy, I haven't seen you since you was a baby, Harry, but you're a bit more along than I would have expected. Particularly 'round the middle!
Dudley: I-I-I'm not Harry.
[Harry reveals himself]

Harry: I-I am.
Hagrid: Oh, well, of course you are! Got something for ya. 'Afraid I might have sat on it at some point! I imagine that it'll taste fine just the same. Ahh. Baked it myself. [Hands Harry the cake] Words and all. Heh.
[Harry opens cake, which reads "Happee Birdae Harry" in green frosting.]

Harry: Thank you!
Hagrid: It's not every day that your young man turns eleven, now is it aye?
[Hagrid sits down on the sofa, takes out an umbrella and points it at the empty fire. Two sparks fly out and the fire starts. The family gasps.]

Harry: [puts cake down] Excuse me, who are you?
Hagrid: Rubeus Hagrid. Keeper of keys and grounds at Hogwarts. Course, you'll know all about Hogwarts.
Harry: Sorry, no.
Hagrid: No? Blimey, Harry, didn't you ever wonder where your mum and dad learned it all?
Harry: Learned what?
Hagrid: You're a wizard, Harry.
[Harry looks confused]

Harry: I-I'm a what?
Hagrid: A wizard. And a thumping good one at that, I'd wager. Once you train up a little.
Harry: No, you've made a mistake. I can't be...a-a wizard. I mean, I'm just... Harry. Just Harry.
Hagrid: Well, just Harry. Did you ever make anything happen? Anything you couldn't explain when you were angry or scared? [Harry softens his expression] Ah.
[Dudley whimpers. Hagrid hands Harry the same letter that has been sent the past while. Harry opens it.]

Harry: Dear, Mr. Potter. We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts' School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
Vernon: [to Hagrid] He'll not be going! We swore when we took him in, we’d put a stop to this rubbish!
Harry: You knew? You knew all along and you never told me?
Petunia: Of course we knew. How could you not be? My perfect sister being who she was. Oh, my mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter. We have a witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful? I was the only one to see her for what she was. A freak! And then she met that Potter, and then she had you, and I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange, just as ... abnormal. And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up. And we got landed with you.
Harry: [to Petunia, angrily] Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash!
Hagrid: A car crash? A car crash kill James and Lily Potter?
Petunia: We had to tell him something.
Hagrid: It's an outrage! It's a scandal!
[As the Dursleys argue with Hagrid, no one, including Harry, is noticing Dudley taking Harry's cake away]

Vernon: He'll not be going!
Hagrid: Oh, and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself's going to stop him, are you?
Harry: Muggle?
Hagrid: [to Harry, calmly] Non magic folk. [he immediately draws his attention back to Vernon and Petunia in anger] This boy's had his name down ever since he was born! [As Hagrid was talking, Dudley was munching on Harry's cake.] He's going to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world, and he'll be under the finest headmaster that Hogwarts has ever seen: Albus Dumbledore.
[Harry smiles upon hearing Dumbledore's name]

Vernon: I will not pay for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricks!
[Hagrid whips out his umbrella and points it at Vernon, threateningly.]

Hagrid: Never, insult Albus Dumbledore, in front of me.
[Hagrid finally sees Dudley eating Harry's cake, and aims his umbrella at his rear. He fires a magic spark at it, causing a grey tail to grow.]

Dudley: Ahh!
[The Dursleys shriek in both fright and horror, as they run off out of sight. Harry laughs at this, so does Hagrid.]

Hagrid: Oh, um, I'd appreciate if you didn't tell anyone at Hogwarts about that. Strictly speaking, I'm not allowed to do magic.
Harry: [Nods] Okay.
Hagrid: [checks his pocket-watch] Ooh, we're a bit behind schedule. Best be off. [he goes off to the door and pulls it down again, before stepping out. He turns to Harry] Unless you'd rather stay, of course. Hmm?
[He walks out. Harry grins, looks back at the direction where the Dursleys are gone, and grins again, before grabbing his jacket and joins Hagrid on their journey to London.]

Diagon Alley
[The next day, in the streets of London.]
(Extended Version)
[Harry and Hagrid are in the underground tube.]

Harry: [reading the list] First year students will require: three sets of work robes, one wand. [He turns to Hagrid]
Hagrid: Essential bit of equipment, Harry.
Harry: One pair of dragon-hide gloves. [he turns to Hagrid again] Hagrid, do they mean for a real dragon?
Hagrid: Well, they don't mean for a penguin, do they? Heh. Crikey, but not a dragon.
Harry: But you like a dragon?
Hagrid: Fast and misunderstood beasts, Harry. Fast and misunderstood. [He suddenly eyes a woman and then he nods. The woman returns to reading her paper.]
(Normal Version)
[The next scene, Hagrid and Harry are walking down the streets.]

Harry: All students must be equipped with...one standard size two pewter cauldron and may bring if they desire either an owl, a cat or a toad. Could we find all this in London?
Hagrid: If you know where to go.
[They walk towards a corner store and as they get closer, the sign above it has “The Leaky Cauldron” magically appearing. They enter the Leaky Cauldron. There was music and several patrons that are speaking to each other.]

Tom: Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?
Hagrid: No thanks, Tom. I'm on official Hogwarts business today. Just helping young Harry here buy his school supplies.
Tom: Bless my soul. It's Harry Potter.
[The pub immediately goes silent and everyone notices. A man comes up and shakes Harry's hand.]

Man: Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.
[A witch comes up and shakes Harry's hand, as well.]

Witch: Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter. I can't believe I'm meeting you at last.
[A man in robes with a turban on his head appears. It is Professor Quirrell.]

Quirrell: Harry P-potter. C-can't tell you how pleased I am to meet you.
Hagrid: Hello, Professor. I didn't see you there. Harry, this is Professor Quirrell. He'll be your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts.
Harry: Oh, nice to meet you. [puts out his hand, offering a handshake with Quirrell. But he looks at Harry's head and hesitatingly refuses]
Quirrell: F-fearfully fascinating subject. N-not that you need it, e-eh, Potter? Heheh.
Hagrid: Yes, well, must be going now. Lots to buy. Heh.
Harry: Goodbye.
[The two leave into a back room winery in front of a brick wall.]

Hagrid: See, Harry, you're famous!
Harry: But why am I famous, Hagrid? All those people back there, how is it they know who I am?
Hagrid: I'm not exactly sure I'm the right person to tell you that, Harry. [Taps the brick wall clockwise with his umbrella. The blocks then magically shift and open up to reveal a hidden, busy street called Diagon Alley.] Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley. [Harry grins broadly as they step into the street and walk down it. An owl screeches.] Here's where you'll get your quills and ink, and over there all your bits and bobs for doing your wizardry.
[Harry is amazed as they pass by shops and owls and bats. The camera pans on a broom store, where a group of boys are crowded around a shiny broom.]

Boy: It's a world class racing broom. Look at it, it’s the new Nimbus 2000! It's the fastest model yet. [the camera pans to see the broom's model name on the handle]
Gringotts
[Harry and Hagrid continue walking down Diagon Alley]

Harry: But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this? I haven't any money.
Hagrid: Well, there's your money, Harry. [he points to a tall, white, marble building, Gringotts Bank] Gringotts, the Wizard Bank. T'aint no place safer, 'cept perhaps Hogwarts.
[Inside the bank, they walk down the shiny aisle, passing tiny creatures working at their desks.]
Harry: Uh, Hagrid, what exactly are these things?
Hagrid: They're goblins, Harry. Clever as they come goblins, but not the most friendly of beasts. Best stick close to me. [Harry sticks to him. Hagrid clears his throat as they approach a counter with a goblin, wearing spectacles and a waistcoat, in it.] Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal.
[The goblin looks up.]

Goblin: And does Mr. Harry Potter have his key?
Hagrid: Oh. Wait a minute. Got it here somewhere. Hah. There's the little devil. [Whispers] Oh, and there's something else as well. [Takes out a letter wrapped in a string.] Professor Dumbledore gave me this. [Hagrid hands the Goblin the letter.] It's about you-know-what in vault you-know-which.
Goblin: Very well.
[Later, they race down the depth caverns in a cartlike structure. The cart stops, a goblin called Griphook, clambers out.]

Griphook: Vault 687. Lamp, please. [Hagrid hands him the lamp and he walks to the vault] Key please.
[Hagrid hands him the key and Griphook unlocks the vault. The room is filled nearly top to bottom with coins. Harry is amazed.]

Hagrid: Didn't think your mum and dad would leave you with nothing now, did ya?
[They continue on through the cavern.]

Griphook: Vault 713.
Harry: What's in there, Hagrid?
Hagrid: Can't tell you, Harry. It's Hogwarts business. Very secret.
Griphook: Stand back. [Slides finger down the door. The vault opens to reveal a small white stone package. Hagrid enters the vault and scoops it up. The eerie light it was shining with disappears.]
Hagrid: Best not mention this to anyone, Harry.
[Harry nods in agreement]

Ollivanders
[Outside back in Diagon Alley, Harry and Hagrid are walking through the street. Harry has bought most of his equipment, and is reading his list.]

Harry: I still need...a wand.
Hagrid: A wand? Well, you'll want Ollivanders. [he points to the store] No place better. Run along there, but wait. I just got one more thing I got to do. Won't be long.
[Harry goes into the store, quietly. He looks around. There are shelves of wands in boxes, but no people.]

Harry: [Softly] Hello? Hello?
[Then, a nose came from the back, and a man appears on a ladder and looks at Harry. The man is Ollivander and he smiles.]

Ollivander: I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter. It seems only yesterday that your mother and father were in here buying their first wands. [Picks a wand] Ah. Here we are. [Harry holds it, but does nothing] Well, give it a wave. [Harry is hesitant, but waves. This causes most of the boxes to come flying out and crashing down. Harry jumps and hurriedly puts the wand back on the counter. ] Apparently not. [Gets another wand from a box.] Perhaps this. [Harry waves at a vase, which shatters, startling Harry.] No, no, definitely not! No matter... [gets a wand from a box, but stops and becomes thoughtful] I wonder. [Ollivander hands the wand to Harry. No sooner after he touched it, Harry suddenly glows under it, blowing his hair up and several of the paperwork in the background. Ollivander looked a bit surprised and deep in thought.] Curious, very curious.
Harry: Sorry, but what's curious?
Ollivander: [examining the wand he gave to Harry] I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It just so happens that the phoenix, whose tail feather resides in your wand gave one other feather, just one. It is curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother gave you that scar. [Points to the lighting bolt scar on Harry's forehead]
Harry: And...who owned that wand?
Ollivander: Oh, we do not speak his name. The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why, but I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things...terrible, yes, but great. [he hands Harry back his wand.]
[Harry then hears a knock on the window.]

Hagrid: Harry! Harry! Happy birthday! [Has a snowy owl in a cage, which hoots, her name is Hedwig.]
Harry: [amazed] Wow.
The Boy Who Lived
[Later back in the Leaky Cauldron, Hagrid and Harry, are at a long table, eating soup. Everything is too quiet, Hagrid soon notices this.]

Hagrid: You all right, Harry? You seem very quiet.
Harry: He killed my parents, didn't he? The one who gave me this. You know, Hagrid, I know you do.
Hagrid: [sighs and pushes his bowl away] First, and understand this, Harry, 'cause it's very important. Not all wizards are good. Some of them go bad. A few years ago, there was one wizard who went as bad as you can go. And his name was V-...his name was V-...
Harry: Maybe if you wrote it down?
Hagrid: No, I can't spell it. All right. [quietly] Voldemort.
Harry: Voldemort?
Hagrid: Shh!!
[Harry looks around to see if anyone heard it]

Hagrid: It was dark times, Harry, dark times. [We flash over to a flashback on the night at Godric's hollow, consisting off a cloaked man walking towards a house, breaking in with his wand, and proceeding to terrorize. Hagrid narrates.] Voldemort started to gather some followers, brought 'em over to the dark side. Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead. Your parents fought against him, but nobody lived once he decided to kill 'em. [Harry's mother, Lily, screams in pain as she is killed by Voldemort's wand. Green flashes are seen from the windows outside the house. Then, we see Voldemort pointing his wand at an infant Harry Potter's head.] Nobody...not one. ‘Cept you.
[We flash back to the present time.]

Harry: Me? Voldemort tried to kill...me?
Hagrid: Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry. A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse...and an evil curse at that.
Harry: What happened to...to You-Know-Who?
Hagrid: Well, some say he died. Codswallop in my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's out there, still, too tired to carry on. But one thing's absolutely certain. Something about you stumped him that night. That's why you're famous. That's why everybody knows your name. You're the boy who lived.
Platform 9¾
[King's Cross Station. Up on a crossing bridge, Harry, with his cart of his baggage, equipment and Hedwig, walk beside Hagrid. A couple look at Hagrid, suspiciously.]

Hagrid: What're you looking at? [He then checks watch] Blimey, is that the time? Sorry, Harry, I'm gonna have to leave you. Dumbledore'll be wanting his- well, he'll be wanting to see me. Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes. Here's your ticket. [hands the train ticket] Stick to it, Harry that's very important. Stick to your ticket.
[Harry looks at his ticket.]

Harry: Platform 9¾? But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake. This says Platform 9¾. There's no such thing...is there? [Harry looks up, but we now see that Hagrid has vanished and Harry all alone with his cart.]
[Harry is walking down lane between trains. A man rushes by.]

Man: Sorry.
[Harry sees a guard.]

Harry: Excuse me, excuse me.
Guard: Right on your left, ma'am.
Harry: Excuse me, sir. Can you tell me where I might find Platform 9¾?
Guard: [incredulous] 9¾? Think you're being funny, do ya? [he walks off]
[Harry then notices a woman, daughter, and four boys walk by, pushing carts.]

Mrs. Weasley: It's the same year after year. Always packed with Muggles, of course.
Harry: Muggles?
Mrs. Weasley: Come on. Platform 9¾ this way! All right, Percy, you first.
[A tall boy with red hair, called Percy, comes forward and runs towards a brick wall. Amazingly, he disappears right into it. Harry is amazed.]

Mrs. Weasley: Fred, you next.
George: He's not Fred, I am!
Fred: Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother.
Mrs. Weasley: Oh, I'm sorry, George.
[Fred moves towards the wall]

Fred: I'm only joking. I am Fred. [He runs through the wall, and is followed by his twin brother. Harry shakes his head in disbelief.]
Harry: Excuse me! C-could you tell me how to-
Mrs. Weasley: How to get on the platform? Yes, not to worry, dear. It's Ron's first time to Hogwarts as well. [pan to a red haired boy, called Ron, who smiles] Now, all you've got to do is walk straight at the wall between platforms 9 and 10. Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous.
Ginny: Good luck.
[Harry takes a breath and runs at the wall. He shuts his eyes and emerges on the other side a magnificent station at Platform 9¾ with a red train, which is the Hogwarts Express, and bundles of people. A whistle blows, and Harry sighs with relief.]

Ron and Hermione
[Later on, the Hogwarts Express is travelling through the countryside. Harry is in sitting alone in a train compartment, and Ron appears in the doorway.]

Ron: Excuse me, do you mind? Everywhere else is full.
Harry: No, not at all.
Ron: [sits across from Harry] I'm Ron, by the way. Ron Weasley.
Harry: I'm Harry. Harry Potter.
[Ron goes agape.]

Ron: So-so it's true? I mean, do you really have the...the...
Harry: The what?
Ron: [whispers] Scar...?
Harry: Oh [lifts up his hair bangs to reveal it]
Ron: Wicked.
[A trolley comes by the compartment, full of sweets.]

Woman: Anything off the trolley, dears?
Ron: [Holds up his mushed sandwiches] No, thanks, I'm all set. [smacks lips.]
Harry: We'll take the lot! [pulls out coins]
Ron: Whoa!
[A bit later, Harry and Ron are not sitting together eating bundles of sweets. Ron's rat, Scabbers, is perched on Ron's knee, a box over his head.]

Harry: Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans?
Ron: They mean every flavour! There's chocolate and peppermint, and there's also spinach, liver and tripe. George sweared he got a bogey-flavoured one once!
[Harry quickly takes the bean he was chewing out of his mouth.]

Harry: [picks up a blue and gold package] These aren't real chocolate frogs, are they?
Ron: It's just a spell. Besides, it's the cards you want. Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard. I got about 500 meself. [Harry opens the package, and a chocolate frog jumps onto the window and climbs up.] Watch it! [The frog reaches the open gap in the window, and jumps out.] Oh, that's rotten luck. They've only got one good jump in them to begin with.
Harry: [seeing Dumbledore's image in the card] I got Dumbledore!
Ron: I got about 6 of him.
[Harry looks at the card again, but Dumbledore has vanished.]

Harry: Hey, he's gone!
Ron: Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you? [Scabbers squeaks] This is Scabbers, by the way, pathetic, isn't he?
Harry: A little.
Ron: Fred gave me a spell as to turn him yellow. Want to see?
Harry: Yeah!
Ron: [clears throat] Ahem. Sun-
[A girl called Hermione Granger, with bushy brown hair, dressed in robes, appears at the doorway.]

Hermione: Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville's lost one.
Ron: No.
Hermione: Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then.
Ron: [clears throat again] Sunshine, daises, butter mellow, turn this stupid fat rat yellow!
[He zaps Scabbers, but nothing happens. Ron shrugs.]

Hermione: Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? Of course I've only tried a few simple spells myself, and they've all worked for me. For example... [Hermione goes over and sits across from Harry. He points her wand at his glasses and Harry tenses] Oculus Reparo. [The tape on the nose-band vanishes, repairing his glasses as if they were good as new. Harry takes them off, amazed.] That's better, isn't it? Holy Cricket, you're Harry Potter. I'm Hermione Granger...and you are...?
Ron: [with his mouth full] I'm...Ron Weasley. ..
Hermione: Pleasure. You two better change into your robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon. [Gets up and leaves, then comes back and looks at Ron.] You've got dirt, on your nose, by the way, did you know? Just there. [Points to the dirt mark on Ron's nose. Ron scratches his nose, embarrassed.]
Welcome to Hogwarts
[It is nighttime at Hogsmeade station, the train blows its whistle and pulls into outside the station. Hagrid walks along the side aisle, with a lantern. People, in their robes, begin pouring out of the train.]

Hagrid: Right, then! First years! This way, please! Come on, now, don't be shy! Come on now, hurry up!
[Harry and Ron, now in their robes, walk up to Hagrid.]

Hagrid: Hello, Harry.
Harry: Hey, Hagrid.
Ron: Whoaa!
Hagrid: Right then. This way to the boats! Come on, now, follow me.
[Later, a large number of boats are plugging across a vast lake, where up ahead a huge castle, known as the Hogwarts Castle, can be seen. People are in awe.]

Ron: Wicked.
[They continue on further towards the castle. Later on, the first year students walk in the castle, and up the staircase. As the camera pans, we see on a higher level, Professor McGonagall is waiting. She taps her fingers on a stone railing, and then goes to the top of the stairs to greet the newcomers.]

McGonagall: Welcome to Hogwarts. Now, in a few moments, you will pass through these doors and join your classmates. But before you can take your seats, you must be sorted into your houses. They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Now while you’re here, your house will be like your family. Your triumphs will earn you house points. Any rule breaking, and you will lose points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup.
[A scared looking boy called Neville Longbottom, spots his toad sitting near McGonagall. He jumps forward.]

Neville: Trevor! [he catches his toad; McGonagall stares down at him as some of the students laugh] Sorry. [He backs away, embarrassed.]
McGonagall: The sorting ceremony will begin momentarily. [she leaves to go into the Great Hall]
[A young evil looking boy, with short blonde hair, called Draco Malfoy, speaks up.]

Draco: It's true then, what they're saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts. [some of the students are heard whispering, "Harry Potter?" Draco introduces his two friends.] This is Crabbe and Goyle. And I'm Malfoy...Draco Malfoy. [Ron snickers at his name] Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair, and a hand-me-down robe? You must be a Weasley. Well, soon find that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. Don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there. [extends his hand to Harry.]
Harry: [not going to take Draco's arrogance] I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks.
[Draco glares. McGonagall returns and taps Draco on the shoulder with a paper. He leaves Harry with one last glare.]

McGonagall: We're ready for you now. Follow me.
The Sorting Hat
[She leads everyone through two large doors and into the Great Hall, where there are four long tables with thousands of students, as well as floating candles. The roof appears to be the sky.]

Hermione: It's not real, the ceiling. It's just bewitched to look like the night sky. I read about it in Hogwarts: A History.
[McGonagall leads the first-years to the front where the Sorting Hat lies on the stool.]

McGonagall: Will you wait along here, please? Now, before we begin, Professor Dumbledore would like to say a few words.
[Dumbledore rises from the main table.]

Dumbledore: I have a few start of term notices I wish to announce. The first years please note that the dark forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch [shows a ragged old man, called Mr. Argus Filch, with his cat with red eyes, called Mrs. Norris.] has asked me to remind you that the 3rd floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. Thank you.[He sits back down]
McGonagall: When I call your name, you will come forth, I shall place the sorting hat on your head, and you will be sorted into your houses. Hermione Granger.
Hermione: [to herself] Oh, no. Okay, relax. [She goes up]
Ron: Mental that one, I'm telling you.
[Harry nods in agreement. Hermione sits on the stool and McGonagall places the sorting hat on her head]

Sorting Hat: Ah, right then...hmm...right. Okay...Gryffindor!!
[The students cheer; Hermione jumps off with a smile.]

McGonagall: Draco Malfoy.
[Draco saunters up proudly. The tattered hat nearly freaks before touching down on Draco's head.]

Sorting Hat: SLYTHERIN!
[The students cheer, not as loudly]

Ron: There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin.
McGonagall: Susan Bones.
[A small, redhead goes up. Harry looks around and notices a black greasy haired, pale man, called, Severus Snape, giving him sinister looks. His scar hurts.]

Harry: Ahh! [puts his hand on his forehead in pain]
Ron: [concerned] Harry, what is it?
Harry: Nothing... nothing, I'm fine.
Sorting Hat: Let's see...I know...Hufflepuff!
McGonagall: Ronald Weasley.
[Ron gulps and walks up. He sits down and the hat is put on.]

Sorting Hat: Ha! Another Weasley. I know just what to do with you... Gryffindor!!
[The students cheer as Ron sighs in relief.]

McGonagall: Harry Potter.
[Everything goes silent. Harry walks up and sits down on the stool. The Sorting Hat is placed on his head.]

Sorting Hat: Hmm...difficult, very difficult. Plenty of courage I see, not a bad mind, either. There's talent, oh yes, and a thirst to prove yourself. But where to put you?
Harry: [whispering to the hat] Not Slytherin. Not Slytherin.
Sorting Hat: Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure? You could be great, you know. It’s all here in your head. And Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness! There's no doubt about that. No?
Harry [still whispering] Not Slytherin...anything but Slytherin.
Sorting Hat: Well, if you're sure... better be... GRYFFINDOR!!
[There is an immense cheering and Harry goes to the Gryffindor table.]

Fred and George: We got Potter! We got Potter!
[Harry sits down at the table. He looks at Dumbledore, who lifts up his goblet and slightly waves it, as if he was wishing congratulations.]

Nick and Other Residents
[Later, all of the first years are sorted in their houses, all of the students were talking to each other. McGonagall dings on a cup.]

McGonagall: Your attention, please.
Dumbledore: [rising from his chair] Let the feast...begin.
[From the aerial view of the Great Hall, food magically appears on all the tables, and the hall is filled with awe and chatter.]

Harry: Wow.
[Draco looks at all the food, raises his eyebrows and digs in. Ron stuffs his face.]

Seamus: I'm half and half. Me dad's a Muggle. Mam's a witch. Bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out.
[Neville laughs. Harry is sitting next to Percy. He leans over.]

Harry: Say, Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?
Percy: Oh, that's Professor Snape, head of Slytherin house.
Harry: What's he teach?
Percy: Potions. But everyone knows it's the Dark Arts he fancies. He's been after Quirrell’s job for years.
[Ron, having just finished a chicken wing, reaches into the bowl for more, and a ghost, called Sir Nicolas, pops out.]

Ron: Ahh!
Nick: Hello! How are you? Welcome to Gryffindor.
[Numerous ghosts come pouring from the walls, sailing along.]

Bloody Baron: Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Girl: Look, it’s the Bloody Baron!
Percy: Hello, Sir Nicholas. Have a nice summer?
Nick: Dismal. Once again, my request to join the headless hunt has been denied. [Begins to leave]
Ron: I know you! You're Nearly Headless Nick!
Nick: I prefer Sir Nicholas if you don't mind.
Hermione: Nearly headless? How can you be nearly headless?
Nick: Like this. [Grabs head and pulls it to the side. His head is hanging on just by a thread.]
Ron: Ahh!
[Hermione moans in disgust; Harry just simply rolls his eyes. Nick reattaches his head back to his body. Later, Percy is leading the Gryffindors to the staircase tower.]

Percy: Gryffindors, follow me, please. Keep up. Thank you.
Boy: Ravenclaws, follow me. This way.
Percy: This is the most direct path to the dormitories. Oh, and keep an eye on the staircases...they like to change.
[The camera pans up and we see a vast amount of staircases, people walking on them, and some switching places.]

Percy: Keep up, please, and follow me. Quickly now, come on. Come on.
[They begin walking up the stairs, several of the portraits began greeting them]

Neville: Seamus, that picture's moving!
Ron: Look at that one, Harry!
Harry: I think she fancies you.
Girl: Oh, look! Look! Who's that girl?
Man in a painting: Welcome to Hogwarts.
Girl: Who's that?
[A bit later on the seventh floor, They are in the corridor leading to Gryffindor Tower. They come up to a large painting of a large woman in a pink dress. She is known as "The Fat Lady".]

The Fat Lady: Password?
Percy: Caput Draconis. [The Fat Lady smiles and nods in confirmation. The painting opens up to reveal a doorway in the wall, leading to Gryffindor Tower.] Follow me, everyone. Keep up, quickly, come on.
Girl: Oh, wow.
Percy: [Inside the common room] Gather 'round here. Welcome to the Gryffindor Common Room. Boy's dormitories, upstairs and down to your left. Girls, the same on your right. You'll find that your belongings have already been brought up.
[Later at midnight. Harry is sitting by a window in his pj's, with Hedwig. He pets the owl and looks out the window, sighing with content, knowing that he will love it here at Hogwarts.]

Potions and Parcels
[It is morning at Hogwarts, Harry and Ron are running in the corridors, because they are late for Transfiguration class. In the class, a tabby cat is sitting on a desk. Harry and Ron rush in; Hermione rolls her eyes in annoyance because they're late for class.]

Ron: Whew, we made it. Can you imagine the look on McGonagall's face if we were late?
[The cat jumps off the desk and transforms into Professor McGonagall, on-screen for the first time. The two boys are amazed.]

Ron: That was bloody brilliant.
McGonagall: Thank you for that assessment, Mr. Weasley. Perhaps if I were to transfigure Mr. Potter and yourself into a pocketwatch, that way one of you might be on time.
Harry: We got lost.
McGonagall: Then perhaps a map? I trust you don't need one to find your seats.
[Later on, inside Snape's potions classroom, the students are chattering, sitting near steaming cauldrons. The door slams open and Snape comes rushing in.]

Snape: There will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion making. However, for those select few... [looks at Draco, who smiles] who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory and even put a stopper... [Draco looks on] in death. [Draco raises his eyebrows. Snape sees Harry, writing what Snape said in his lecture down, in, his view, not paying attention.] Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confidant enough to not...pay...attention. [Hermione nudges Harry, finally making him look up to the Professor. Snape then walks to where he can speak to Harry more properly.] Mr. Potter. Our...new...celebrity. Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood? [Hermione raises her hand. Harry shrugs.] You don't know? Well, let's try again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar? [Hermione's hand raises again.]
Harry: I don't know, sir.
Snape: And what is the difference between monkshood and wolfbane?
Harry: I don't know, sir.
Snape: Pity. Clearly, fame isn't everything... [Draco has a smirk on his face] is it, Mr. Potter?
(Extended Version)
 

Harry: Clearly, Hermione knows. Since it's a pity not to ask her.
[Hermione looks a bit surprised as everyone laughs]

Snape: Silence. [he turns to Harry, looking a bit insulted; Harry seemingly gulps. Snape then walks over to his desk. To Hermione, who has still got her hand up.] And put her hand down, you silly girl. [He sits in front of Harry, and leans towards him.] For your information, Potter... asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful, it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. [everything is quiet] Well? [to the students] Why aren't you all copying this down? [The students obey Snape and start to write down what Snape said. Snape returns to his desk, and dips his quill into some ink.] And Gryffindors, note that five points, will be taken from your house... for your classmate's cheek. [Snape then starts writing; Hermione looks at Harry and then starts writing. Harry looks at Snape, who turns slightly and then continues writing]
(Normal Version)
[Harry stares at Snape, knowing that he shows dislike for the boy. In the great hall, around midday. The students are all doing their homework. Seamus is trying a spell on a cup.]

Seamus: Eye of rabbit, harp string hum. Turn this water, into rum. [Looks in cup and shakes head.] Eye of rabbit, harp string hum...
Harry: What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?
Ron: Turn it into rum. Actually managed a weak tea yesterday, before-
[Ron was cut off when a mighty flash occurs. We now see that the cup has exploded and Seamus is left charred. Several students laugh at this as Hermione fans away the smoke with her hand. Suddenly, a flock of owls start coming into the hall from the rafters above.]

Ron: Ah. Mail's here!
[The owls soar by, dropping parcels to students. Harry gets nothing. He sees the newspaper Ron has put down.]

Harry: Can I borrow this? [Ron nods] Thanks.
[Neville is unwrapping a gift. It is a clear glass ball with a gold banner around it.]

Dean:  Hey, look! Neville's got a Remembrall!
Hermione: I've read about those. When the smoke turns red, [the smoke turns red] it means you've forgotten something.
Neville: The only problem is, I can't remember what I've forgotten.
Harry: Hey, Ron, somebody broke into Gringotts, listen. [he reads the article] Believed to be the work of dark witches or wizards unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowledging the breach, insist that nothing was taken. The vault in question, number 713, had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. That's odd. That's the vault Hagrid and I went to.
New Seeker
[That afternoon, outside the castle, the students, Gryffindor and Slytherin, are lined up in two rows with brooms by their sides. The teacher, Madam Hooch, comes down the line. She has short hair and hawk yellow eyes.]

Hooch: Good afternoon, class.
Class: Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.
Hooch: Good afternoon, Amanda, good afternoon. [to the class] Welcome to your first flying lesson. Well, what are you waiting for? Everyone step up to the left side of their broomstick. Come on now, hurry up. Stick your right hand over the broom and say, up!
Class: Up!
[After Harry said "Up”!, the broom immediately flies into his hand.]

Harry: [amazed] Wow.
[Hermione stares at him as the class continues.]

Draco: Up! [broomstick flies up and Draco smugly grins.]
Hooch: With feeling!
Hermione: [as her broomstick slowly rises] Up. Up. Up. Up.
Ron: Up!! [His broom immediately shot up and whacked him on the nose] Ooh! [Harry laughs] Shut up, Harry. [Ron then seemingly starts to laugh after he recovered]
Hooch: Now, once you've got hold of your broom, I want you to mount it. And grip it tight, you don't want to be sliding off the end. [the class mounts on their broomsticks] When I blow my whistle, I want each of you to kick off from the ground, hard. Keep your broom steady, hover for a moment, and then lean forward slightly and touch back down. On my whistle...3...2...
[She blows the whistle. However, Neville's broomstick somehow lifts him off the ground. Neville immediately lifts off. He looks quite frightened.]

Neville: Oh...
Hooch: Mr. Longbottom.
Girl: Neville, what are you doing?
Students: Neville...Neville...
Boy: We're not supposed to take off, yet.
Hooch: [Neville begins soaring away uncontrollably] M-M-Mr. Longbottom! Mr. Longbottom!
Neville: AHH!
Hooch: Mr. Longbottom!
Neville: Down! Down! Ahhhh!
Harry: Neville!
Neville: Help!!!
[he immediately skyrockets towards the sky]

Hooch: Come back down this instant!
Neville: AHH!
[He flies uncontrollably in the air and hits a wall, conking along it and then swooping off. All the while, he is screaming. He begins to zoom back towards the group of students. Hooch quickly holds out her wand to stop him.]

Neville: Help!
Hooch: Mr. Longbottom-! [However, the students quickly stand back as Hooch dives out of the way, allowing Neville to fly right through. Neville goes through the scatter and up a tower.]
Neville: Ahhhh! Whoa! Ahhh! [zooms past a statue of a man with a sharp spear. Neville's cloak catches on it. He is flipped off the broom and hangs there.] Oh. Ah...help! [He wavers, then the cloak rips through the spear, and he falls. But his cloak catches on a torch, making Neville slip off from his cloak a second later and fell to the ground.] Ahh!
Hooch: Everyone out of the way! [She runs through the group, and they scatter.] Come on, get up.
Girl: Is he alright?
[Hooch is helping Neville up; he has broken his wrist after he fell.]

Neville: Owowowow.
Hooch: Oh, oh, oh, oh dear. It's a broken wrist. Tch, tch, tch. Good boy, come on now, up you get. [Draco reaches down and grabs Neville's Remembrall, which has fallen from him. Hooch begins to lead Neville away with her.] Everyone's to keep their feet firmly on the ground while I take Mr. Longbottom to the hospital wing. Understand? If I see a single broom in the air, the one riding it will find themselves out of Hogwarts before they can say, Quidditch. [she leaves to the hospital wing.]
Draco: [snickers] Did you see his face? Maybe if the fat lump had given this a squeeze, he'd have remembered to fall on his fat arse. [He and his goons laugh; Harry approaches him.]
Harry: Give it here, Malfoy.
Draco: No. I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find. [he hops on his broom and soars around group, then through.] How 'bout up on the roof? [soars off and hovers several feet above the grounds.] What's the matter, Potter? Bit beyond your reach?
[Finally having enough, Harry gets on his broom, Hermione stops him.]

Hermione: Harry, no way! You heard what Madam Hooch said! Besides, you don't even know how to fly. [Harry flies off to face Draco, ignoring her.] What an idiot.
[Harry is now in the air, across from Draco.]

Harry: Give it here, Malfoy, or I'll knock you off your broom!
Draco: Is that so? [Harry makes a dash for him, but Draco twirls around his broom in a 360.] Have it your way, then!
[Draco hurls the Remembrall into the air, like a baseball. Harry zooms after the ball, speeding towards a tower. Just as he is about to hit a window, from which McGonagall is working, he catches it. McGonagall notices this and looks surprised as Harry begins to fly back down to the grounds. The students all cheer as Harry lands back on the ground at ease. They run to see him.]

Boy: Good job, Harry!
Boy 2: Oh, that was wicked, Harry.
[McGonagall appears in the grounds.]

McGonagall: Harry Potter? [Harry notices her] Follow me. [Harry sullenly follows her. Draco and his goons snicker in delight.]
[McGonagall and Harry arrive outside of Professor Quirrell's classroom. He is inside, teaching, holding an iguana.]

Quirrell: An iguana s-such as this is...
McGonagall: You wait here.
Quirrell:... an essential in-gredient.
McGonagall: Professor Quirrell, excuse me, excuse me. Could I borrow Wood for a moment, please?
Quirrell: Oh. Y-yes, of course. [A boy called Oliver Wood, gets up to leave and Quirrell continues.] And the vampire b-bat... [as Wood exits the classroom, an eerie roar is heard.]
McGonagall: Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood, I have found you a Seeker!
[Harry and Ron are walking through crowded halls. Sir Nicholas and a lady ghost float by.]

Nick: Have you heard? Harry Potter's the new Gryffindor Seeker. I always knew he'd do well.
Ron: Seeker? But first years never make their house teams! You must be the youngest Quidditch player in...
Harry: A century, according to McGonagall.
[Fred and George approach and walk along with Ron and Harry.]

Fred: Hey, well done, Harry, Wood's just told us!
Ron: Fred and George are on the team, too. Beaters.
George: Our job is to make sure that you don't get bloodied up too bad. Can't make any promises, of course. Rough game, Quidditch.
Fred: Brutal. But no one's died in years. Someone will vanish occasionally... [They break off from Harry and Ron, who walk across a courtyard.]
George: But they'll turn up in a month or two!
Ron: Oh, go on, Harry, Quidditch is great. Best game there is! And you'll be great, too!
[Hermione, knowing what Harry is talking about, jumps up from her work and comes to join them.]

Harry: But I've never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of myself?
Hermione: You won't make a fool of yourself. It's in your blood.
[Later, the three approach a trophy case. Hermione points at a plaque of Quidditch players. One lists Harry's father as a Seeker.]

Ron: Whoa. Harry, you never told me your father was a Seeker, too.
Harry: I-I didn't know.
Three-Headed Sentinel
[The three are walking up a staircase in the Grand Staircase tower. A railing pulls in, Hermione looks, but continues walking.]

Ron: I'm telling you, it's spooky. She knows more about you than you do.
Harry: Who doesn't?
[The staircase shudders and begins to move. The three grab the railings.]

Ron: Ahh!
[Hermione gasps]

Harry: What's happening?
Hermione: The staircases change, remember? [The staircase stops, leading to a corridor.]
Harry: [taps Ron] Let's go this way.
Ron: Before the staircase moves again.
[They all open a door and walk into a spooky, dark and deserted corridor.]

Harry: Does anyone feel like...we shouldn't be here?
Hermione: We're not supposed to be here. This is the 3rd floor. It's forbidden.
[Suddenly, a flame lights on a tall stone support. At that moment, Filch's cat, Mrs. Norris, comes running in and meows. The group jumps.]

Harry: Let's go.
[Mrs. Norris meows]

Ron: It's Filch's cat!
Harry: Run!
[The trio run through the corridor, flames are lit up on the stone supports, one by one, as they run past. They get to the end of the corridor, to a door.]

Harry: Quick! Let’s hide though that door!
[Harry grabs the handle, but it's locked.]

Harry: It's locked!
Ron: That's it, we're done for!
Hermione: Oh, move over! [pushes through and pulls out her wand, aiming it at the lock] Alohomora. [The door's lock lifts up magically and it opens.] Get in. [They bustle in.]
Ron: Alohomora?
Hermione: Standard book of spells, Chapter 7.
[Filch arrives at the start of the corridor with a light. Mrs. Norris looks at him.]

Filch: Anyone here, my sweet? [Mrs. Norris meows] Come on. [they leave the corridor.]
Hermione: Filch is gone.
Ron: Probably thinks this door's locked.
Hermione: It was locked.
Harry: And for good reason. [Ron and Hermione turn to stand with Harry. There is a massively huge three headed dog sleeping in front of them. The dog begins to wake. It growls, yawns, and growls more...noticing the intruders.]
All: AHHHHHHH! [The three bolt, running out of the door. They turn quickly to shut the door and battle against the dog. They get the door shut and run.]
[They return to the Gryffindor Common Room. They are breathless.]

Ron: What do they think they're doing?? Keeping a thing like that locked up in a school.
Hermione: You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?
Ron: I wasn't looking at its feet! I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice, there were three! [they begin to climb the stairs to the dorms.]
Hermione: It was standing on a trap door. Which means it wasn't there by accident. It's guarding something.
Harry: Guarding something?
Hermione: That's right. Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed... or worse, expelled! [turns and leaves, shutting the door to her dormitory.]
Ron: She needs to sort out her priorities!
[Harry nods in agreement]

Facts and Feathers
[Outside in the courtyard, day time. Oliver and Harry appear, carrying a trunk. They put it down.]

Oliver: Quidditch is easy enough to understand. Each time has seven players, 3 chasers, 2 beaters, 1 keeper and a seeker. That's you. There are three kinds of balls. [picks up a red one] This one's called the Quaffle. Now, the chasers handle the Quaffle and try to put it through one of those three hoops. [Points to the hoops in the Quidditch pitch in the distance.] The keeper, that's me, defends the hoops. [throws ball to Harry.] With me so far?
Harry: [throws back] I think so. What are those? [points to two squirming chained down balls.]
Oliver: You better take this. [hands Harry a small bat. He bends down and releases one ball. With an angry growl, it flies off into the air. The two boys watch it.] Careful now, it's comin' back. [The balls comes whizzing down, and Harry cracks at it with the bat. The ball soars off through a statue, surprisingly without damaging it.] Eh, not bad, Potter, you'd make a fair beater... Uh-oh. [The ball zooms down, and Oliver grabs it, wriggling to get it back in the box. He succeeds and is out of breath.]
Harry: What is that?
Oliver: Bludger. Nasty little buggers. But you are the seeker, and the only thing I want you to worry about is this... the Golden Snitch. [hands Harry a walnut sized golden ball.]
Harry: I like this ball.
Oliver: Ah, you like it now. Just wait. It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see.
Harry: What do I do with it?
Oliver: You catch it... before the other team's seeker. You catch this, the game is over. You catch this, Potter, and we win.
[The ball flutters out two delicate wings and jumps into the air. Harry keeps an eye on it.]

Harry: Whoa.
[In Professor Flitwick's class. Filtwick is very short, and is standing on a bunch of books to make up for his stature and to see his class.]

Flitwick: One of a wizard's most rudimentary skills is levitation the ability to make objects fly. Uh, do you all have your feathers? [Hermione raises hers.] Good. Now, uh, don't forget the nice wrist movement we've been practicing, hmm? The swish and flick. Everyone.
All (including Flitwick): The swish and flick.
Flitwick: Good. And enunciate. Wingardium Leviosa. Off you go then.
[The class begin to enunciate and doing the movements on their feathers]

Draco: Wingardium Levio-saaa.
Ron: Wingardrium Leviosar! [he waves his wand really fast numerous times. Hermione stops him.]
Hermione: Stop, stop, stop. You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, you're saying it wrong. It's Levi-o-sa, not Leviosar.
Ron: You do it then if you're so clever. Go on, go on.
[Hermione straightens up and swishes her wand.]

Hermione: Wingardium Leviosa. [The feather glows and lifts up.]
Flitwick: Oh, well done! See here, everyone! Ms. Granger's done it! Oh, splendid!
[Ron puts his head on his books dejectedly. Seamus begins swishing at his feather.]

Seamus: Wingard Levosa.
Flitwick: Well done, dear.
[An almighty explosion flashes. Flitwick gasps, as Ron and Hermione turn to the source of the explosion]

Flitwick: Whooaaa! Ooh.
[We see that Seamus is charred again with his feather, now smoldering to ashes.]

Harry: I think we're going to need another feather over here, Professor.
[Neville, Harry, Ron and Seamus are walking through a courtyard with other students all around.]

Ron: [mimicking Hermione] It's Levioooosa, not Leviosaaaar. [normal voice] She's a nightmare, honestly. No wonder she hasn't got any friends!
[Hermione rushes past Ron, hugging her books and sniffling in tears.]

Harry: I think she heard you.
[Hermione disappears into the crowd, deeply hurt by Ron's words.]

Mountain Troll
[That Halloween night, the great hall has floating Jack O'Lanterns in place of the candles. Harry notices an empty spot on the bench.]

Harry: Where's Hermione?
Neville: Parvati Patil said that she wouldn't come out of the girl's bathroom. She said that she'd been in there all afternoon...crying.
[Harry glances at Ron with a disapproving look on his face; Ron shrugs. Suddenly, Professor Quirrell comes running into the Great Hall in panic.]

Quirrell: TROLL! IN THE DUNGEON! T-TROOLLL IN THE DUNGEON!! [Dumbledore rises from his seat in concern. Everyone look at Quirrell and he stops and there is utter silence.] Thought you ought to know.
[He passes out. The room is silent, and then everyone freaks out, screaming and running.]

Dumbledore: SILLLLLEEENNNNCEEEEE! [Everyone stops and calms down.] Everyone will please, not panic. Now, Prefects will lead their houses back to the dormitories. Teachers will follow me to the dungeons.
Girl: Hufflepuff, this way!
Boy: Stay together!
[Snape looks aghast, and he walks out through a doorway. A bit later, Percy is leading the house down a corridor.]

Percy: Gryffindors, keep up please. And stay alert!
Harry: How could a troll get in?
Ron: Not by itself. Trolls are really stupid. Probably people playing jokes. [Suddenly, Harry stops and pulls Ron aside.] What?
Harry: Hermione! She doesn't know!
[The two separate themselves from the crowd. They run down corridors. They start running down a hall when they stop, because there is a grunting noise and a large shadow on the wall.]

Ron: I think the troll's left the dungeon!
[Harry pulls Ron into a doorway, they peer out to see a large, ugly troll thunks by into a room.]

Harry: It’s going into the Girl's Bathroom!
[In the bathroom, Hermione emerges from a stall, wiping her eyes. She stops when she sees something. The troll is standing there. Hermione backs up, into the stall just as the troll raises its club and smashes the top part of the stalls. Hermione screams. Harry and Ron come bursting in.]

Harry: Hermione, move!
[The troll smashes the remaining stalls.]

Hermione: Help! Help! [The boys start throwing wood pieces at the troll.]
Ron: Hey, pea brain! [Ron throws wood and hits the troll on the head. Hermione escapes from the stalls to under a sink, but the troll sees her and goes to smash her. It cracks the sink and barely misses Hermione. Harry cringes.]
Hermione: Ahhh! Help!
[Harry gets out his wand. He runs forward and grabs the troll's club, and is lifted up.]

Harry: Whooa! Whoa, whoa! [He lands on the troll's head, and is hurled forward, then back, and his wand shoots up the troll's nose.]
Ron: Ew.
[Ron and Hermione were disgusted by Harry’s sand in the troll’s nose. The troll snorts, and whips around.]

Harry: Whoa, whoa whoa!
[The troll gets Harry off its head and is holding him by one leg, upside down.]

Harry: Do something!
[It gears up its club and swipes at Harry. He pulls himself up, then down. The troll swipes again.]

Ron: What? [the troll swipes at Harry repeatedly]
Harry: Anything! Hurry up!
[Ron grabs his wand. Under the sink, Hermione waves her hand.]

Hermione: Swish and flick!
Ron: [correctly punctuating the words] Wingardium Leviosa! [Flick. The club is lifted out of the troll's hand and hovers above its head. The troll looks up, confused, just as the club comes crashing back down.] Cool. [It hits the troll's head that hard and the troll wavers, then drops Harry, who crawls away, and slowly comes crashing down, knocking him out. Hermione approaches carefully.]
Hermione: Is it...dead?
Harry: I don't think so. Just knocked out. [He grabs his wand...which is covered in mucus.] Ew. Troll bogies.
[Harry wipes his wand on his robes. Suddenly, McGonagall, Snape and Quirrell come rushing in. They all gasp at the knocked out troll.]

McGonagall: Oh! Oh, my goodness! E-Explain yourselves, both of you!
Ron and Harry: Well, what it is...
Hermione: It's my fault, Professor McGonagall. [The teachers, Ron and Harry look at her.]
McGonagall: Miss Granger?
Hermione: I went looking for the troll. I'd read about them and thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me...I'd probably be dead.
McGonagall: Be that as it may be...it was an extremely foolish thing to do. [Harry notices Snape's leg, which has the trousers' leg torn and a large cut on it. Snape notices and covers it up, glaring at Harry.] I would have expected more rational behavior on your part, Miss Granger. Five points will be taken from Gryffindor for your serious lack of judgment. [she turns to Harry and Ron] As for you two gentlemen I just hope you realize how fortunate you are. Not many students could take on a fully grown mountain troll and live to tell the tale. Five points...will be awarded to each of you. [Harry and Ron grin at each other] For sheer dumb luck.
[Snape and McGonagall leave the bathroom]

Quirrell: Perhaps you ought to go...M-might wake up...heh. [Harry, Ron and Hermione exit the bathroom. Quirrell looks at the unconscious troll. The troll growls, seemingly going to wake up.] Ahh! Hehe....
(Extended Scene)
[Harry, Ron and Hermione are walking back to the Gryffindor Common Room through the corridor.]

Harry: [to Hermione] Good for you to get us out of trouble like that.
Ron: Mind you, I mean, we did save her life.
Harry: Mind you, she didn't need saving if you hadn't insulted her.
[Hermione looks at Ron.]

Ron: What are friends for?
[They both smile at each other as they carry on through the corridor.]

Quidditch
[The next morning, in the great hall. The gang is sitting, eating. Harry is twirling his food on a fork.]
Ron: Take a bit of toast, mate, go on.
Hermione: Ron's right, Harry. You're gonna need your strength today.
Harry: I'm not hungry.
[Snape appears at the table.]

Snape: Good luck today, Potter. Then again, now that you've proven yourself against a troll, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you...even if it is against Slytherin. [Snape walks off, limping. Harry notices this.]
Harry: That explains the blood.
Hermione: Blood?
Harry: Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog. But, he got himself bitten, that's why he's limping.
Hermione: But why would anyone go near that dog?
Harry: The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. He said it was Hogwarts' business, very secret.
Hermione: So you're saying...
Harry: That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants.
[Hedwig screeches as she enters the Great Hall. She is carrying a very large, long parcel. She drops it off at the table.]
Hermione: Bit early for mail, isn't it?
Harry: But I-I never get mail.
Ron: Let's open it.
[They open it to reveal a broomstick.]

Harry: It's a broomstick!
Ron: Thats not just any broomstick, Harry. [recognizing the model] It's a Nimbus 2000!
Harry: But who...?
[He notices Professor McGonagall up at the head table, stroking Hedwig. She smiles and Harry nods.]
[Later on, inside a Quidditch tower. The Gryffindor team is marching towards the starting gate. They reach it and stop, behind a closed double door.]

Oliver: Scared, Harry?
Harry: A little.
Oliver: That's all right. I felt the same way before my first game.
Harry: What happened?
Oliver: Er, I don't really remember. I took a bludger to the head 2 minutes in. Woke up in the hospital a week later.
[Harry gulps and looks straight ahead as the doors open. They mount their brooms and zoom out onto the enormous pitch. There is cheering. Lee Jordan, the Quidditch commentator is announcing from a tower.]

Lee: Hello, and welcome to Hogwarts' first Quidditch game of the season! Today's game Slytherin versus Gryffindor!!!
[Cheering. Close-up of Gryffindor students. They are cheering.]

Neville: Gryffindor!
[The players take their positions in the air in a circle. Harry weaves in, highest amongst. He looks down.]

Lee: The players take their positions as Madam Hooch steps out onto the field to begin the game.
Hooch: Now, I want a nice clean game...from all of you. [looks at Slytherin. She kicks the trunk, and the bludgers zoom out.]
Lee: The bludgers are up...followed by the Golden Snitch. Remember, the snitch is worth 150 points. The seeker who catches the Snitch ends the game.
[The snitch zooms around each Seeker's head, then disappears. Hooch grabs the Quaffle.]

Lee: The Quaffle is released...and the game begins!
[Gryffindor takes possession of the ball and a chaser, Angelia Johnson, zooms past the Slytherins towards their goal, and throws the ball, and scores! There is a ding.]

Lee: Angelina Johnson scores! 10 points for Gryffindor! [He presses a button and a 10 shows up beside a plaque with Gryffindor’s name.]
[Harry, in the air, claps.]

Harry: Yes! [a bludger suddenly zooms by him.] Whoa!
[In the stands, Gryffindor cheers.]

Hagrid: Well done!
Lee: Slytherin takes possession of the Quaffle. Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.
[Flint dodges people and throws for the Gryffindor hoops. Oliver appears and whacks the ball away with his broom. He smirks at Flint, who glares. Johnson and Katie Bell pass the Quaffle back and forth as they strategize to score. Johnson takes it, throws, and once again scores!]

Ron and Seamus: Yay!
Harry: Yes!
Lee: Another 10 points to Gryffindor! [he adds another 10 to the score with a ding.]
Gryffindors: Yay!
[The Slytherins decide to get messy. They dodge, kick, and try to score. Once again, Oliver blocks.]

Flint: Give me that! [he grabs a beaters bat from one and whacks a bludger right at Oliver. It hits Oliver directly in the stomach and he plummets to the ground, knocked out.]
[This causes the entire audience to boo; Harry is visibly upset as the Slytherins laugh. The Slytherin members head off. One jumps over George (or Fred) and scores. Lee adds 10 points in the plaque with Slytherin's name. Harry is upset again. Slytherin cheers.]

Flint: [to his teammates] Take that side!
[They box Johnson in and sent her into the capes covering one of the towers. She falls down in and is out. The crowd boos. Slytherin scores once again. 

Interference Overcome
[Suddenly, Harry sees the Snitch. He starts to head off after it and then suddenly his broom starts bucking and turning.]
Harry: Whoa! Whooa!
Hagrid: What's going on with Harry's broomstick?
[Hermione looks through binoculars at Harry, then at Snape, who is visibly muttering.]

Hermione: It's Snape! He's jinxing the broom!
Ron: Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
Hermione: Leave it to me. [She hands Ron her binoculars and leaves the stands.]
[Harry is knocked and thrown around, then falls, dangling by one arm from the broom.]

Ron: [concerned] Come on, Hermione!
[Hermione is hurrying up in the tower structures. She appears underneath Snape and touches his cloak with her wand.]

Hermione: [quietly] Lacarnum Inflamarae.
[A spark ignites and Snape's cloak catches fire. Hermione quickly leaves.]

Man: Fire! You're on fire!
Snape: What? Oh! [knocks the man back, who falls into Quirrell, who then also falls. Snape bats out the fire and acts as though nothing happened. The broom stop bucking, and Harry climbs back on. The Slytherin seeker is after the Snitch. Harry takes off.]
Ron: Go!
Hagrid: Go go go!
[Harry rams the Slytherin Seeker, then is butted out. He returns, smashing the Seeker again as the Snitch dives. The boys follow, but they approach the ground quickly. The Slytherin Seeker backs out, and Harry pulls up his broom as he follows the Snitch, feet above the ground. Harry stands up, and steps forward, trying to grab the ball. He goes too far, and topples off the broom with a yelp, tumbling on the ground. He gets up and lurches. The crowd gasps. Hermione appears beside a tower to see.]

Hagrid: Looks like he's gonna be sick!
[Harry lurches and the Snitch pops out of his mouth. It lands in his hands.]

Lee: He's got the Snitch! Harry Potter receives 150 points for catching the Snitch!
Hooch: [Blows her whistle whilst riding on her broomstick] Gryffindor win!
[The crowd cheers in joy including Gryffindor]

Draco: [dismayed] No!
Hagrid: Yes!
Hermione: Whoo-hoo!
[McGonagall giggles happily. Harry raises the Snitch into the air and the crowd, and his team, cheers.]

Crowd: Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor!
Christmas Gift
[Harry, Hermione and Ron are walking along a path with Hagrid, talking.]

Hagrid: Nonsense! Why would Snape put a curse on Harry’s broom?
Harry: Who knows? Why was he trying to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween?
Hagrid: [turns to them, suspiciously] Who told you ‘bout Fluffy?
Ron: Fluffy?
Hermione: That thing has a name?
Hagrid: Well, of course he's got a name. He's mine. I bought him off an Irish feller I met down at the pub last year. Then I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the..
Harry: Yes?
Hagrid: Shouldn’t have said that. No more questions! Don’t ask any more questions. That's top secret, that is.
Harry: But, Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it.
Hagrid: Codswallop. Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher.
Hermione: Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a spell when I see one. I've read all about them. You've got to keep eye contact and Snape wasn't blinking.
Harry: Exactly.
Hagrid: [Sighs] Now, you listen to me, all three of you. You're meddling in things that ought not to be meddled in. It's dangerous. What that dog is guarding is strictly between Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.
Harry: [Curious and turns to Ron then back to Hagrid] Nicholas Flamel?
Hagrid: [Mumbles to himself] I shouldn't said that. I should not have said that.
[He then leaves, mumbling to himself "I should have not said that"]

Harry: Nicholas Flamel. [Turns to Hermione] Who's Nicholas Flamel?
Hermione: I don't know. [Shakes her head]
[It is now Christmas at Hogwarts, with snow falling. Hagrid is dragging a massive Christmas tree to the castle.]
[Hermione walks to the Great Hall entrance with her luggage and wearing a scarf as the ghosts are singing Christmas songs.]

Ghosts: Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Ring the Hogwart bell. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas...
[Hermione looks from the massive Christmas tree as Flitwick uses his wand to put another ornament on the tree to Harry and Ron as they play Chess and walks towards them.]
Harry: Knight to E5. [The Knight moves to its destination. Hermione walks up behind Harry.]
Ron: [With a smug face] Queen to E5.
[Hermione watches as Ron's queen goes over to Harry's knight and whacks the knight with her chair. Ron grins.]

Hermione: [With a shocked face] That's totally barbaric!
Ron: That's wizard's chess. [Looks over to Hermione] I see you've packed.
Hermione: See you haven't.
Ron: Change of plans, my parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother Charlie. He's studying dragons there.
Hermione: Good, you can help Harry, then. He's going to go and look in the library for information on Nicholas Flamel.
Ron: We've looked a hundred times.
Hermione: [Leans over on the table closer to Ron and Harry] Not in the restricted section. Happy Christmas. [Hermione leaves Ron and Harry]
Ron: [Looks at Harry] I think we've had a bad influence on her.
[It is now Christmas morning. Ron is waking Harry up]

Ron: [From downstairs] Harry wake up! Come on Harry, wake up!
[Harry puts on his glasses and runs out of bed. He then looks down at Ron]
Ron: [Looking up at Harry] Happy Christmas, Harry.
Harry: Happy Christmas, Ron. [Harry notices Ron's sweater] What are you wearing?
Ron: [Looks down at sweater] Oh. My mum made it. [Looking back up at Harry] It looks like you've got one too.
Harry: I-I've got presents?
Ron: [Nodding] Yeah!
[Harry runs down the staircase to see his presents]

Ron: There they are.
[Harry sees a note on the present and opens it, reading it out]

Harry: Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well. [Harry looks over to Ron, who shrugs his shoulders]
[Harry then proceeds to open the remaining of his present. He pulls out a blanket-like object]

Ron: What is it?
Harry: [Looking down at the object] It's some kind of cloak.
Ron: Well, let's see then, put it on.
[Harry then wraps the cloak around his shoulders, making his body invisible]

Ron: Whoa!
Harry: [Looks down at his invisible body] My body's gone!
Ron: I know what that is. That's an invisibility cloak.
Harry: I'm invisible? [Harry spins around, looking down at himself]
Ron: They're really rare. [Ron looks down at the note] I wonder who gave it to you?
Harry: [Now also looking down at the note] There was no name. It just said use it well.
Cloaked in darkness
[Late at night. A lantern and hand appear, but nothing else. The ensemble walk through the dark library and into the Restricted Section. The lamp is put down, and the cloak removed, revealing to be Harry who searches the bookshelves.]

Harry: Famous fire eaters...15th Century Fiends...Flamel...Nicholas Flamel...where are you?
[Harry picks up a book and opens it. A man's face appears from between the pages, which screams madly and loudly. Harry immediately slams the book shuts and puts it back.]

Filch: Who's there?! [Harry whips around, and quickly grabs his cloak, causing the lamp to fall and shatter.] I know you're in there. You can't hide. [Harry puts on his cloak and creeps around Filch.] Who is it? Show yourself!
[Harry runs from the room, breathing heavily. He exits into the hall, where Mrs. Norris, who meows and begins to follow him. Harry runs around a corner, just as Snape and Quirrell appear. Snape pushes Quirrell into the wall.]

Quirrell: Severus...I-I thought...
Snape: You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell.
Quirrell: W-what do you m-mean?
Snape: You know perfectly well what I mean. [Snape senses something who causes Harry to stop breathing. Snape reaches out to grab something, but doesn't. He whips his finger back in front of Quirrell's face.] We'll have another chat soon...when you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie.
[Filch arrives, carrying the broken lantern.]

Filch: Oh, Professors. I found this, in the Restricted Section. It's still hot. That means there's a student out of bed.
[Upon hearing this, Snape and Quirrell dart off]

The Mirror of Erised
[A door opens, and closes. On the other side, there is a vast, empty room that has a large mirror in the center, known as the Mirror of Erised. Harry appears and walks over to the mirror. In the reflection, he sees two people appear who are Harry's late parents, James and Lily Potter.]

Harry: Mum? [Lily nods and smiles] Dad? [James nods and smiles. Harry reaches out to touch them, but only gets the mirror. Then, his mother puts her hand on his shoulder. He puts his own hand on his own shoulders, as if trying to feel her there.]
[Back in the boy's dormitory in Gryffindor tower, Harry comes whipping in, invisible.]

Harry: Ron! You've really got to see this! Ron! You've got to see this! [pulls back covers. Ron wakes up.] Ron, Ron, come on. Get out of bed!
Ron: [tired] Why?
Harry: There's something you've got to see. Now, come on!
[Back in the room. Harry and Ron appear as if magically and Harry runs to the mirror.]

Harry: Come on. Come. Come look, it's my parents!
Ron: I only see me.
Harry: [moves over] Look in properly. Go on. Stand there. There. You see them, don't you? Thats my dad
Ron: That's me! Only, I'm head boy...and I'm holding the Quidditch cup! And bloody hell, I'm Quidditch Captain too! I look good. Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?
Harry: How can it? Both my parents are dead. [Harry smiles sadly.]
(Extended Version)
[One day, in the Great Hall where most of the students, particularly the Weasleys are eating, Harry sits in front of the fireplace.]

George: Do you like yours, Ron? [Ron turns to harry who still sits in front of the fireplace who is very quiet.] Ron?
Ron: I'll be right back. [He leaves the table and comes up to Harry.] Want to play chess?
Harry: No.
Ron: We go and visit Hagrid?
Harry: No.
Ron: Harry, I know what you're thinking, but don't. There's something not quite right about that mirror.
[Harry nods and Ron leaves to go back to the table as Harry continues to stare at the fireplace.]
(Original Version)
[The next night, Harry is back in the room where the mirror is, gazing longingly at the reflection where his parents are in. Dumbledore appears far behind him]

Dumbledore: Back again, Harry? [Harry turns around and stands up.] I see that you, like so many before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. I trust by now you realize what it does. Let me give you a clue. The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is.
Harry: So, then it shows us what we want? Whatever we want?
Dumbledore: [whilst looking at the mirror] Yes...and no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and I must ask you not to go looking for it again. It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live. [Harry looks back at the mirror, knowing that Dumbledore is right.]
Norbert
[It is snowy in daytime, Harry is out in a main courtyard, bundled up, with Hedwig on his arm. He stops and she lifts off, soaring away into the sky. As the time passed when she returns, it is now spring time.]
(Extended Version)

Harry: Hi, Hedwig. [Hedwig has just flown down to the table where Harry, Ron and Hermoine are studying]
Hermione: Look at you playing with your cards. Pathetic! We've got final exams coming up soon.
Ron: I'm ready! Ask me any question.
Hermione: All right, what are the three most crucial ingredients in a Forgetfulness Potion?
Ron: ...I forgot.
Hermione: And what, may I ask, do you plan to do if this comes up in the final exam?
Ron: Copy off you?
Hermione: No, you won't! Besides, according to Professor McGonagall, we're to be given special quills bewitched with an anti-cheating spell.
Ron: That's insulting! It's as if they don't trust us! [checks a card, irritated] Dumbledore again!
[Just then, Neville Longbottom comes hopping into the Great Hall with his legs stuck together as the other students laugh at him.]

Ron: Leg-Locker Curse?
Harry: Malfoy. [Neville approaches them amidst laughter from the other students]
Ron: You have got to start standing up to people, Neville.
Neville: [wobbling uncontrollably] How? I can barely stand at all!
Seamus: [jumping up, wand at the ready] I'll do the counter-curse!
Neville Longbottom: No, that's all I need... you to set my bloody kneecaps on fire!
Seamus: [slamming his wand down angrily] I don't appreciate the insinuation, Longbottom. Besides, if anyone cares to notice, my eyebrows have completely grown back! [He then stalks off angrily, showing a large chunk of hair missing from the back of his head.]
Harry: I found him! [hands Ron a Chocolate Frog card of Dumbledore]
Ron: 'Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark" Wizard Grindelwald in 1945–'
Harry: Go on.
Ron: '-for his discovery of the 12 uses of Dragon Blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner Nicolas Flamel!'
Harry: I knew the name sounded familiar. I read it on the train that day.
Hermione: [beaming excitedly] Follow me!
[the Trio tears out of the Great Hall, leaving poor Neville still flailing around]
Neville Longbottom: Hey, wait, where are you going? What about the counter-curse?! [before he can say another word he topples over backwards, the other students start laughing.]
(Original Version)
[In the library, Harry and Ron are seated, reading until Hermione comes up with a huge book and thumps it onto the table making Harry jump.]

Hermione: I had you looking in the wrong section! How could I be so stupid? I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading.
Ron: This is light?
Hermione: Of course! Here it is! [as she reads the description in the page] "Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!"
Ron and Harry: The what?
Hermione: Honestly, don't you two read? "The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal."
Ron: Immortal?
Hermione: It means you'll never die.
Ron: I know what it means!
Harry: Shh!
Hermione: "The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his 665th birthday!" That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor. That's what's under the trapdoor...the Philosopher's Stone!
[They all look at each other in concern. It is nighttime in the castle grounds, Hermione, Ron and Harry are running across to Hagrid's hut. They knock on the door and Hagrid, who is wearing an apron and oven mitts, opens it from the inside.]

Harry: Hagrid!
Hagrid: Oh, hello. Sorry, don't wish to be rude, but I'm in no fit state to entertain today.
[He begins to close the door]

All three: We know about the Philosopher's Stone!
[Hagrid opens the door again]

Hagrid: Oh.
[They all come into Hagrid's hut.]

Harry: We think Snape's trying to steal it.
Hagrid: Snape? Blimey, Harry, you're not still on about him, are you?
Harry: Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone. We just don't know why.
Hagrid: Snape is one of the teachers protecting the Stone! He's not about to steal it!
Harry: What?
Hagrid: You heard. Right. Come on, now, I'm a bit preoccupied today.
Harry: Wait a minute. [Ron soon sees Hagrid's boar-hound Fang, who sniffs him.] One of the teachers?
Hermione: [whilst sitting in a large chair] Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments.
Hagrid: That's right. Waste of bloody time, if you ask me. [Hermione looks at Ron, who is still being sniffed in the face by Fang. Finally Ron shuffles away.] Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy. Hehe, not a soul knows how. Except for me and Dumbledore. I shouldn't have told you that. I shouldn't have told you that. [A cauldron over a fire begins to rattle.] Oh! [Hagrid hurries over and grabs something] Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! [He places it on the table. It was an egg. The group crowds around.]
Harry: Uh, Hagrid, what exactly is that?
Hagrid: That? It's a ... its um...
Ron: I know what that is! But Hagrid, how did you get one?
Hagrid: I won it. Off a stranger I met down at a pub. Seemed quite glad to be rid off it, as a matter of fact.
[The egg rattles and cracks open as pieces fly off; a small baby dragon emerges. It squeaks and slips on an egg piece.]

Hermione: Is that...a dragon?
Ron: That's not just a dragon. That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.
Hagrid: Isn't he beautiful? Oh. Bless him, look. He knows his mummy. Hehe. Hallo, Norbert.
[Norbert squeaks as it looks at Hagrid.]

Harry: Norbert?
Hagrid: Yeah, well, he's got to have a name, doesn't he? [Ron laughs] Don't you, Norbert? [he raises fingers back and forth across Norbert's chin] Dededede.
[Norbert backs away, until he hiccups and blast a small fireball into Hagrid's beard.]

Hagrid: Ohh! [he quickly pats out the smolders in his beard] Oooh, ooh, ooh, well...he'll have to be trained up a bit, of course. [Norbert hiccups. Hagrid sees someone looking in the window.] Who's that? [It turns out to be Draco Malfoy, who scampers away.]
Harry: Malfoy.
Hagrid: Oh, dear.
[Harry, Ron and Hermione are walking back through a corridor as an owl screeches.]

Harry: Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me so the first time I met him.
Ron: It's crazy. And worse, Malfoy knows.
Harry: I don't understand. Is that bad?
Ron: It's bad.
[They stop as McGonagall, in her nightgown, appears, sternly.]

McGonagall: Good evening.
[Then, Malfoy appears smugly beside her. Inside McGonagall's classroom, the three are now standing in front of McGonagall's desk, while Malfoy is feet away, smirking.]

McGonagall: [sternly] Nothing, I repeat, nothing gives a student the right to walk about the school at night. Therefore, as punishment for your actions, 50 points will be taken.
Harry: 50?!
McGonagall: Each. [Harry gasps] And to ensure it doesn't happen again, all four of you will receive detention.
[Malfoy nods, then his smile vanishes with great concern.]

Draco: Excuse me, Professor. Perhaps I heard you wrong. I thought you said..."the four of us."
McGonagall: No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy. You see, as honorable as your intentions were, you too were out of bed after hours. You will serve detention with your classmates.
[Harry, Ron and Hermione grin, as Draco sags, knowing that the tables have turned.]

The Forbidden Forest
[The next night, Harry, Ron, Hermione and Draco are being led to Hagrid's hut by Mr. Filch.]

Filch: A pity they let the old punishments die. There was a time detention would find you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons. God, I miss the screaming. [Draco gulps, and Hermione rushes by.] You'll be serving detention with Hagrid tonight. He's got a little job to do inside the dark forest. [Hagrid appears with a crossbow. He sniffles.] A sorry lot this, Hagrid. Oh, good God, man, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you?
Hagrid: [sniffs and sighs] Norbert's gone. Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony.
Hermione: Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind.
Hagrid: Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania? {Filch rolls eyes.} What if the other dragons are mean to him? He's only a baby, after all.
Filch: Oh, for Gods sake, pull yourself together, man. You're going into the forest, after all. Got to have your wits about you.
Draco: The forest? I thought that was a joke! We can't go in there. Students aren't allowed. And there are...[a howl sounds]...werewolves!
Filch: There's more than werewolves in those trees, lad. You can be sure of that. [Draco looks frightened.] Nighty-night. [He leaves to go back into the castle]
Hagrid: Right. Let's go.
[In the Forbidden Forest, the group walks along a path to a tree. Hagrid stops, bends down and dips his fingers in a silver puddle. He pulls out his fingers and rubs them together. A silver trail smears with his fingers.]

Harry: Hagrid, what's that?
Hagrid: What we're here for. See that? That's unicorn's blood, that is. I found one dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one's been injured bad by something. [Harry suddenly sees a large cloaked figure walking through the trees. He looks at Hagrid.] So, it's our job to find the poor beast. Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me.
Ron: Okay.
Hagrid: And Harry, you'll go with Malfoy. [Draco grimaces, and Harry nods.]
Draco: Okay. Then I get Fang!
Hagrid: Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward. [Fang whines.]
[Harry and Draco are walking through a part of the forest, with Fang leading. Draco has the lamp in his hand.]

Draco: You wait till my father hears about this. This is servant's stuff.
Harry: If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared.
Draco: Scared, Potter?! [He scoffs, but suddenly hears a howl] Did you hear that? Come on, Fang. Scared.
[Harry and Draco approach a flat ground with gnarled roots all over. Fang stops, then growls.]

Harry: What is it, Fang?
[Up ahead is a cloaked figure who is crouching over a dead unicorn, drinking its blood from its wound. The figure raises its head, silver blood dripping from its mouth. Harry gasps and grabs his scar, which is hurting. Draco screams with pure fear and runs away with Fang.]

Draco: HELP!!!!!
[Harry is left by himself at the mercy of the figure who slides over the unicorn and rises erect. It advances towards Harry, who backs up, but trips. He crawls backwards. Suddenly, there is the sound of hoof-beats. A figure leaps over Harry and lands near the cloaked figure. It is a silver centaur called Firenze. It rears, and the cloaked figure retreats, flying away.]

Firenze: Harry Potter, you must leave. You are known to many creatures here. The forest is not safe at this time. Especially for you.
Harry: But what was that thing you saved me from?
Firenze: A monstrous creature. It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death. But at a terrible price. You have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life. A cursed life.
Harry: But who would choose such a life?
Firenze: Can you think of no one?
Harry: Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort?
Firenze: Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?
Harry: [realizing] The Philosopher's Stone.
[Fang suddenly barks and Harry looks up to see Hagrid, Hermione, Ron and Draco appear. Hagrid has his crossbow ready, but lowers it when he sees Firenze.]

Hermione: Harry!
Hagrid: Hello there, Firenze. I see you've met our young Mr. Potter. You all right there, Harry? [Harry nods]
Firenze: Harry Potter, this is where I leave you. You're safe now. Good luck.
[He leaves as the group look at the dead unicorn.]

Up to Something
Hermione: [she, Harry, and Ron are meeting in the common room] You mean You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest?
Harry: But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong! Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself; he wants the Stone for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. He'll... he'll come back.
Ron: But, if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to... kill you, do you?
Harry: I think if he'd had the chance, he might've tried to kill me tonight.
Ron: [gulps] And to think I've been worrying about my Potions final.
Hermione: Hang on a minute. [Harry and Ron both glance at her] We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared? Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore's around, Harry, you're safe. As long as Dumbledore's around, you can't be touched. [gives him a reassuring smile; he nods]
[Later all the students are rushing out as they finish their exams.]
Hermione: I'd always heard Hogwart’s end-of-year exams were frightful, but I’ve found they're rather enjoyable.
Ron: Speak for yourself. All right there, Harry?
[We see Harry walking next to the two rubbing his forehead right where the scar is.]
Harry: My scar. It keeps burning.
Hermione: It's happened before...
Harry: Not like this.
Ron: Perhaps you should see the nurse.
Harry: I think it's a warning. It means danger's coming. [A look of realization] Ah... Oh! Of course!
[Harry starts walking faster making Hermione and Ron speed up to catch him]
Hermione: What is it?
Harry: Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have one? I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pocket? Why didn't I see it before?
[They approach Hagrid's hut and he is playing a flute.]
Harry: Hagrid, [Hagrid stops playing] who gave you the dragon egg? What did he look like?
Hagrid: I dunno. I never saw his face. He kept his hood up.
Harry: This stranger though, you and he must have talked.
Hagrid: Well, he- he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. I told him, I said, after Fluffy a dragon's gonna be no problem.
Harry: Did he seem interested in Fluffy?
Hagrid: Well, o’ course he was interested in Fluffy! How often do you come across a three-headed dog, even if you're in the trade? But I told ‘im, I said, I said, ‘The trick with any beast is to know how to calm ‘im. Take Fluffy, for example, just play him a bit o’ music, and he falls straight to sleep.’ I shouldn't have told you that. [The Trio runs off] Where are you going? Where are you-?
[Harry, Hermione, and Ron run into the Transfiguration classroom to talk to McGonagall.]
Harry: We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately!
McGonagall: I’m afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here. He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London.
Harry: He’s gone! Now! But, this is important! This is about the Philosophers Stone!
McGonagall: [Looking shocked] How do you know-?
Harry: Someone’s going to try to steal it!
McGonagall: I don’t know how you three found out about the Stone, but I assure you it is perfectly well protected. Now, would you go back to your dormitories, quietly
[They leave the classroom talking to each other.]
Harry: That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. It was Snape. Which means, he knows how to get past Fluffy.
[Snape sneaks up behind them]
Hermione: And with Dumbledore gone-
Snape: Good afternoon. Now, what would three young Gryffindors, such as yourselves, be doing inside on a day like this?
[The three of them jump and quickly turn around.]
Hermione: Ah, w- w- w... we- we were just-
Snape: You ought to be careful. People will think you’re... up to something. [Walks away]
Hermione: Now, what do we do?
Harry: [With a determined look] We go down the trap door, tonight.
Through the Trapdoor
[Nighttime. In the Gryffindor Common Room. The three friends come down the stairs and begin to walk across the floor. They stop when they hear croaking.]
Harry: Trevor.
Ron: Trevor shh! Go, you shouldn't be here!
Neville: [appears behind a chair] Neither should you. You're sneaking out again, aren’t you?
Harry: Now, Neville, listen. We were -
Neville: No! I won't let you! [stands] You'll get Gryffindor in trouble again! I-I'll fight you. [Neville holds out his fists.]
Hermione: Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this...[takes out wand] Petrificus Totalus.
[Neville is frozen and falls backwards onto the ground. Hermione puts her wand back.]
Ron: [Gulp] You're a little scary sometimes...you know that? Brilliant, but scary.
Harry: Let's go. [Walks by Neville] Sorry.
Hermione: Sorry.
Ron: It's for your own good, you know.
[The three are under the Invisibility cloak, sneaking along the corridor.]
Hermione: Ow! You stood on my foot!
Ron: Sorry. [A flame lights. Hermione draws out her wand and points it at the door.]
Hermione: Alohomora.
[The door opens and they go in.]
Ron: Wait a minute...he's....
[a blow of air, and the cape flutters off them.]
Ron: Sleeping.
Harry: Snape's already been here. He's put a spell on the harp. He’s probably taken my sisters with him. 
[They approach the sleeping dog.]
Ron: Uh. It's got horrible breath!
Harry: We have to move its paw.
Ron: What?!
Harry: Come on! [grabs paw, which is blocking the door.] Okay. Push! [They strain and move it. They open the door.] I'll go first. Don't follow until I give you a sign. [Fluffy's eyes open.] If something bad happens, get yourselves out...Does it seem a bit...quiet?
Hermione: The harp. It stopped playing.
[Drool from one head comes down on Ron's shoulder.]
Ron: Ew! Yuck! Ugh. [All three kids look up and see Fluffy standing there. Fluffy barks and growls, thrashing. It breaks the harp and dives at the three.]
Harry: Jump! Go! [They all jump through the trapdoor.]
Ron: Ahh! [gasps as he lands on some mushy black ropelike vines.] Whoa. Lucky this plant-thing is here, really.
Harry: Whoa! [The plant begins to move towards them.] Oh. Ahh! [The plant ties them up.]
Hermione: Stop moving, both of you. This is Devil's Snare. You have to relax. If you don't, it will only kill you faster.
Ron: Kill us faster?! Oh, now I can relax!
[Hermione manages a smile as she is sucked down below.]
Ron/Harry: Hermione!!
Ron: Now what are we gonna do?!
Hermione: Just relax!
Harry: Hermione! Where are you?!
Hermione: [from below] Do what I say. Trust me.
[Harry relaxes and is sucked through.]
Ron: Ahh! Harry!
[Harry falls through and lands on the hard ground. Hermione goes over to him and he stands up.]
Ron: Harry!
Hermione: Are you okay?
Harry: Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
Ron: Help!
Hermione: He's not relaxing, is he?
Harry: Apparently not.
Ron: Help! Help me!
Hermione: We've got to do something!
Harry: What?
Hermione: Uh! I remember reading something in Herbology. 
Ron: Help!
Hermione: Um Devil's Snare, Devil's Scare, [The snare shuts Ron's mouth] it's deadly fun...but will sulk in the sun! That's it! Devil's Snare hates sunlight! [takes out wand and points upwards.] Lumus Solem! [A beam of light shoots out. The Snare shrieks and recoils. Ron falls below.]
Ron: Ahhh!
Harry: Ron, are you okay?
Ron: Yeah.
Harry: Okay.
Ron: [stands] Whew. Lucky we didn't panic!
Harry: Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.
[There is a sound.]
Hermione: What is that?
Harry: I don't know. Sounds like wings.
[They enter into a room filled with golden "birds."]
Hermione: Curious. I've never seen birds like these.
Harry: They're not birds, they're keys. And I'll bet one of them fits that door. [They come upon a broomstick, suspended in the air.]
Hermione: What's this all about?
Harry: I don't know. Strange.
[Ron creeps over to the door and takes out his wand.]
Ron: [rattles lock.] Alohomora! [Shrugs] Well, it was worth a try.
Hermione: Ugh! What're we going to do? There must be 1000 keys up there!
Ron: We're looking for a big old fashioned one. Probably rusty like the handle.
Harry: There! I see it! [points] The one with the broken wing! [He looks at the broom.]
Hermione: What's wrong, Harry?
Harry: It's too simple.
Ron: Oh, go on, Harry! If Snape can catch it on that old broomstick, you can! You're the youngest seeker in a century! Besides! What about Sunflower and Songbird! They need us! Especially you! 
[Harry nods and grabs the broom. All the keys suddenly go one direction, right at Harry. He climbs on, swiping at them.]
Ron: This complicates things a bit!
[Harry pushes off into the air. He flies off, after the key. The others follow him. Harry grabs the key.]
Harry: Catch the key!
[He zooms by and throws the key to Hermione, who catches it and heads for the lock while Harry distracts the other keys. Hermione puts it in the lock.]
Ron: Hurry up!
[The door opens, and Hermione and Ron rush through, followed by Harry. They shut the door just as the keys slam up against it.]

Wizard's Chess
[They enter a dark room, with broken pieces all around it.]
Hermione: I don't like this. I don't like this at all.
Harry: Where are we? A graveyard?
Ron: This is no graveyard. [sighs] It's a chessboard. [Walks out onto the marble board and flames light, illuminating the board and GIANT players. Harry and Hermione come up with him.]
Harry: There's the door.
[They walk across the board, towards the door. Suddenly, as they reach a line of pawns, the pawns bring up their swords. The three jump and back up.]
Hermione: Now what do we do?
Ron: It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play our way across the room. All right. Harry, you take the Bishop's square. Hermione, you'll be the Queen's side castle. As for me, I'll be a knight. [They all take their places.]
Hermione: What happens now?
Ron: [aboard a horse.] Well, white moves first, and then...we play. [A pawn on the other side moves forward. Ron studies the game.]
Hermione: Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like...real wizard's chess, do you?
Ron: You there! D-5! [A black pawn moves forward, diagonal to the white pawn. The white pawn raises its swords and smashes the black one. The three jump.] Yes, Hermione, I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess!
[The game continues. Pieces smash each other, boom! Boom!]
Ron: Castle to E-4! [Smash!]
Ron: Pawn to C-3! [Smash! Boom! The Queen turns, and smashes a piece! Harry, Ron and Hermione wince.]

Sacrifice Play
[The Queen turns again. Both Ron and Harry study the game.]
Harry: Wait a minute.
Ron: You understand right, Harry. Once I make my move, the Queen will take me...then you'll be free to check the King.
Harry: No, Ron! No!
Hermione: What is it?
Harry: He's going to sacrifice himself!
Hermione: No, Ron, you can't! [Ron closes his eyes.] There must be another way!
Ron: [turns to face Hermione.] Do you want to stop Snape or not? Harry, it's you that has to go on. I know it. Not me, not Hermione, you. [Harry nods.] Knight...to H-3.
[Ron's horse moves forward, slides and stops.]
Ron: Check.
[The Queen turns and advances. Ron breathes faster, clutching the steel reins. The Queen stops. SMASH! Ron goes flying off the horse and lands on the floor, unconscious.]
Ron: Ahhhh!
Harry: RON! [Hermione starts walking to him.] NO! Don't move! Dont forget, we're still playing. [Hermione moves back. Harry walks the diagonal in front of the King.] Checkmate. [The Kings sword falls onto the ground victory. Harry breathes out and then the two run to Ron. They bend beside him.] Take care of Ron. Then, go to the owlery. Send a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right...I have to go on.
Hermione: You'll be okay, Harry. You're a great wizard, you really are.
Harry: Not as good as you.
Hermione: [smile] Me? Books and cleverness? There are more important things. Friendship, and bravery. And Harry, just be careful.
[Harry nods and stands, walking away.]

Man With Two Faces
[Harry walks down the stairs slowly. Halfway down, he winces, feeling his scar burning, and sees Professor Quirrell standing before the Mirror of Erised.]

Harry: You? [Quirrell turns to face him] No. I-it can’t be. Snape, h-he was the one—-
Quirrell: Yes. He does seem the type, doesn’t he? Next to him, who would suspect p-p-p-poor st-stuttering Professor Quirrell?
Harry: But-but that day, during the Quidditch match, Snape tried to kill me.
Quirrell: [smiling evilly] No, dear boy. I tried to kill you. [Harry eyes him in disbelief and confusion] And trust me, if Snape’s cloak hadn’t caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would have succeeded, even with Snape muttering his little countercurse.
Harry: Snape was trying to save me?
Quirrell: I knew you were a danger to me right from the off. Especially after Halloween.
Harry: Then-then you let the troll in.
Quirrell: Very good, Potter, yes. Snape, unfortunately, wasn’t fooled. While everyone else was running about the dungeon, he went to the third floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again. [he turns towards the mirror again; Harry winces as his scar burns again] He rarely left me alone. But he doesn’t understand. I’m never alone, never. [staring into the mirror] Now, what does this mirror do? I see what I desire. I see myself holding the stone. But how do I get it?
Unseen Inhuman Voice: Use the boy. [Harry looks around, wondering where the voice is coming from]
Quirrell: [turns to Harry] Come here, Potter. Now! [Harry slowly walks down the stairs, towards Quirrell and the mirror] Tell me... what do you see? [Harry looks into the mirror, and for a few seconds, sees him standing next to Quirrell, then his reflection reaches into its pocket and pulls out a gleaming red ruby, the Philosopher’s Stone; Harry stares in amazement as his reflection smiles and winks, then puts the stone back in its pocket; Harry feels his pocket and realizes the Stone really is in his pocket, then looks up again] What is it? [glances at Harry while speaking] What do you see?
Harry: [looks at Quirrell, then back at the mirror, determined not to let Quirrell know that he has the Stone] I-I’m shaking hands with Dumbledore. I’ve won the House Cup.
Unseen Inhuman Voice: He lies.
Quirrell: [angrily shouting] Tell the truth! What do you see?!
Unseen Inhuman Voice: Let me speak to him.
Quirrell: [as Harry backs away] Master, you are not strong enough.
Unseen Inhuman Voice: I have strength enough for this.
[Quirrell reaches up and starts unwrapping his turban as he turns so his back is to the mirror. Harry turns toward the staircase into the room, wondering whether he should try to escape, then turns towards Quirrell again. He is almost finished unwrapping his turban, save for a piece covering the back of his head. Finally, he removes the turban, revealing a scary-looking chalk white face, Voldemort. He cranes around and opens his eyes.]
Voldemort: Harry Potter, we meet again.
Harry: [realizing his identity] Voldemort.
Voldemort: Yes. You see what I’ve become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another, a mere parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can, something that, conveniently enough, lies in your pocket. [realizing Voldemort is referring to the Philosopher’s Stone, Harry turns and runs back up the stairs]
Magic Touch
Voldemort: Stop him. [Quirrell snaps his fingers, instantly causing fire walls to block all the exits, trapping Harry in the room] Don't be a fool! Why suffer a horrific death when you can join me and live?
Harry: [shakes his head] Never!
Voldemort: Haha. Bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry, would you like to see your mother and father again? Together, we can bring them back. [In the mirror, Harry's parents appear in the reflection.] All I ask for is something in return. [Harry takes the Stone from his pocket.] That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil. There is only power, and those too weak to seek it. Together, we'll do extraordinary things. Just give me the stone! [James and Lily Potter fade from the reflection]
Harry: You liar!
Voldemort: Kill him!
[Under orders, Quirrell soars into the air and grabs hold of Harry with one hand on his throat. They fall to the steps, causing the Stone falls out of Harry's reach as Quirrell chokes him. Harry strains and squeaks. Suddenly, Harry puts his hand on Quirrell's hand in an attempt to get him off. Smoke furls from under his hand as Quirrell winces.]

Quirrell: Ahh! Ahh! [He backs up away from Harry. His hand is crumbling into ash and dust.] What is this magic? [His hand disintegrates]
Voldemort: Fool! Get the stone!
[Quirrell walks forward towards Harry, who then touches his face with his hands, causing Quirrell to scream in pain, and especially Voldemort to wince. Harry looks on horrified as Quirrell backs up with his face horrendously burned. Quirrell crumbles as he walks forward, turning his body completely in ash and dust, and falls to the floor, leaving only his clothing. Harry gasps, as he looks at his own hands and hurries over to the stone. He picks it up and sighs. However, from behind, dust clouds form from Quirrell's corpse, causing Harry to turn around as the dust clouds with Voldemort's face rushes forward screaming and goes through Harry who also screams. Voldemort flies away, as Harry falls to the ground, unconscious. He holds the Stone in an outstretched hand.]

Mark of Love
[In the hospital wing the next day, Harry is lying in bed with his arm bandaged. He awakens, puts on his glasses, and sits up. There are cards and candy all over. Dumbledore approaches him.]

Dumbledore: Good afternoon, Harry. Ah. Tokens from your admirers?
Harry: Admirers?
Dumbledore: What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. [They both smile.] Ah, I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs.
Harry: Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione?
Dumbledore: Fine. They're both just fine.
Harry: But, what happened to the Stone?
Dumbledore: Relax, dear boy. The stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around.
Harry: But Flamel, he'll die, won't he?
Dumbledore: [sits on the bed.] He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But yes, he will die.
Harry: How is it I got the Stone, sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next...
Dumbledore: Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me that's saying something.
Harry: Does that mean, with the Stone gone, I mean, that Voldemort can never come back?
Dumbledore: Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him? [Harry shakes his head.] It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark. [Harry touches his scar.] No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin.
Harry: What is it?
Dumbledore: Love, Harry, love. [Pats Harry's head gently and stands up.] Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one, and since then I have lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee...[takes brown bean and eats it.] Mm. Alas. Earwax.
House Cup Winner
[Harry with his arm still bandaged enters a corridor where up on a stairwell balcony, Hermione and Ron are talking. They stop when they see Harry and lean over the railing.]

Harry: All right there, Ron?
Ron: All right? You?
Harry: [as he shrugs] All right. Hermione?
Hermione: [smiling] Never better.
[We see the Great Hall, full of students eating and talking with each other. There are green and silver banners with the Slytherin symbol above their heads, already indicating the house with the most points. Dumbledore gives a slight nod to professor McGonagall, who then clinks her spoon to her glass, to ask attention from the students. The crowd falls silent. Dumbledore stands up and speaks with his magically magnified voice.]

Dumbledore: Another year, gone! And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarded and the points stand thus. In fourth place: Gryffindor, with 312 points! [There is a medium applause from the crowd.] In third place: Hufflepuff, with 352 points! [The applause for Hufflepuff is slightly louder than the clapping for Gryffindor.] Second: Ravenclaw, with 426 points! [Applause again, this time with a slight cheer from some students.] And in first place, with 472 points: Slytherin house! [A loud roar rises from the Slytherin table, as students stand up and clap for themselves. Hermione scowls with her hand to her cheek; Snape applauds the students of his house]
Draco: Nice one, mate. [sneers at Ron]
Yes, well done Slytherin, well done Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account and I have a few last minute points to award. [Some faces at the Gryffindor table rise hopefully.] To Miss Hermione Granger, for the cool use of intellect while others were in grave peril: fifty points! :[Hermione looks surprised, while the other Gryffindor students applaud her.]

Harry: [giving Hermione a pat on the back] Good job. [Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle don't like what's happening. Hermione looks at Hagrid, who looks back to her with a proud smile.]
Dumbledore: Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess that Hogwarts has seen these many years: fifty points! [Ron looks even more surprised than Hermione did and the Gryffindor table is applauding even louder.] And third, to Mr. Harry Potter, for pure love and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house: sixty points!

[The Gryffindors cheer again, this time even louder than before. Malfoy has a cringing look on his face, while Harry sees a proud, smiling professor McGonagall at the teacher's table. Hermione, who has done some quick math, whispers to her fellow students.]
Hermione: We're tied with Slytherin!
[Now, the Gryffindors look really hopeful, as Dumbledore hasn't finished talking yet.]
Dumbledore: And finally: it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. I award ten points to Neville Longbottom! [Neville can't believe what he just heard and the Gryffindors that heard Hermione's whisper are cheering the loudest. Malfoy looks quite uncertain now.] Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of decoration is in order! [He claps and motions his hands towards the Slytherin banners, where they flap heavily, until the banners have changed completely to red and gold with the Gryffindor symbol] Gryffindor wins the House Cup!
[The Great Hall explodes with applause, not only from the Gryffindors, but also from the Ravenclaws and the Hufflepuffs, because they are glad that, for the first time in seven years, someone other than Slytherin has won the House Cup. Hagrid can't help himself to also cheer, and all students except the Slytherins throw their hats in the air, while Malfoy angrily throws his on the table in defeat. The Gryffindors around Harry are all congratulating him and Harry smiles to Hagrid, who smiles back.]
Not Really Going Home
[The outdoor train station. Students are walking around, getting in the train.]
Hagrid: Come on now, hurry up. You'll be late. Train's leaving. Go on. Go on. Come on. Hurry up.
[Harry hands Hedwig to a train man, and walks to an open door of the train with Hermione. Hermione waves to Hagrid, who waves back. Hermione gets in the train.]
Hermione: Come on, Harry.
Harry: One minute. [He walks over to Hagrid]
Hagrid: Thought you were leaving without saying good-bye, didja? [Hagrid takes a red album out of his coat pocket and hands it to Harry.] This is for you.
[Harry opens the album and sees a picture, moving, of him as a baby with his parents. They are all smiling and waving. Harry smiles.]
Harry: Thanks, Hagrid. [Shakes Hagrid's hand, then hugs him tightly.]
Hagrid: Oh. Go on...on with you. [Harry lets go] Oh, listen, Harry, if that dolt of a cousin of yours, Dudley, gives you any grief, you could always, um, threaten him with a nice pair of ears to go with that tail of his.
Harry: But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that.
Hagrid: I do. But your cousin don't, do he? Eh? [chuckle] Off you go.
[Harry walks away, back to the train door where Hermione and Ron are waiting.]
Hermione: Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?
Harry: I'm not going home. Not really.
[The train whistles and they climb aboard. As the train starts to leave and the camera pans up over the whole scene, Harry waves out the window to Hagrid, who waves back and then waves more to other students as the camera pans far back, then the credits begin.]

In a Cage
[In the clouds during sunset, we see the Warner Bros. Pictures shield moving towards the screen and rotates out of the shot. Then, the film's title in golden letters slowly zooms through the camera afterwards; it is a quiet summer evening in Surrey. Harry Potter is in his bedroom looking at the picture book that Rubeus Hagrid gave him at the end of his first year at Hogwarts; he looks at the picture of him as a baby with his parents, then turns the page to look at a picture of him with his closest friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger; he then hears his owl Hedwig chirping and hooting in her cage.]
Harry: I can't let you out, Hedwig. I'm not allowed to use magic outside of school. [Hedwig nibbles at her lock, squawking loudly] Besides, if Uncle Vernon--
Vernon: [angrily from downstairs] Harry Potter!
Harry: [glances downstairs then looks at Hedwig before closing his book and going downstairs] Now you've done it.
[In the kitchen, Petunia is working on a cake as Harry enters.]

Petunia: He's in there, Vernon.
[Harry enters the living room, where Uncle Vernon is getting Dudley dressed up.]

Vernon: I'm warning you. If you can't control that bloody bird, it'll have to go.
Harry: But she's bored. If I could only let her out for... an hour or two.
Vernon: [chuckles] So you can send secret messages to your freaky little friends? No, sir.
Harry: But I haven't had any messages from any of my friends. Not one. All summer.
Dudley: Who would want to be friends with you? [bumps Harry harshly]
Vernon: I should think you'd be a little more grateful. We've raised you since you a were a baby, given you the food off our table, even let you have Dudley's second bedroom, purely out of the goodness of our hearts.
Petunia: [to Dudley] Not now, bumpkins. It's for when the Masons arrive.
Vernon: Which should be any minute. [motions for his family to come into the living room] Now, let's go over our schedule once again, shall we? Petunia, when the Masons arrive, you will be...?
Petunia: In the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciously to our home.
Vernon: Good. And, Dudley, you will be...?
Dudley: I'll be waiting to open the door.
Vernon: Excellent. [the three of them turn to Harry with scornful looks] And you...?
Harry: I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending that I don't exist.
Vernon: Too right you will. With any luck, this could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career, and you will not mess it up.
Dobby's Warning
[Harry goes upstairs as the doorbell rings.]

Vernon: [from below] Mr. and Mrs. Mason! Do come in!
[Harry hears someone laughing madly in his room. He opens the door to find, a house elf named Dobby bouncing on his bed.]

Dobby: Harry Potter! Such an honor it is! [Harry closes the door.]
Harry: Who are you?
Dobby: Dobby sir, Dobby the house elf.
Harry: Not to be to be rude or anything, but this isn’t a great time for me to have a house elf in my bedroom.
Dobby: Oh, oh, yes, sir! Dobby understands! It’s just that, Dobby has come to tell you- it is difficult, sir- Dobby wonders where to begin?
Harry: Why don’t you sit down?
Dobby: S-sit down? S-sit- sit down? [he soon begins to cry]
Harry: Dobby, ssh! I’m sorry! [Dobby cries louder] I didn’t mean to offend you, or anything.
Dobby: [stops crying when he hears that word] Offend Dobby? Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but never has he been asked to sit down by a wizard, like an equal.
Harry: You can’t have met many decent wizards then.
Dobby: No, I haven’t. That was an awful thing to say. [he then bangs his head on the dresser drawer repeatedly] Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!
Harry: Stop, Dobby! Dobby, shh! Dobby, please stop!
[From downstairs in the living room, the Dursleys and the Masons are having some wine as they hear the banging from above.]

Vernon: Oh, don't mind that. It's just the... cat! [he chuckles lightly, as Mr. and Mrs. Mason look on, being convinced and concerned at the same time.]
Dobby: [still banging his head on the drawer] Bad Dobby!
Harry: Dobby, stop! Please be quiet. Are you all right?
Dobby: Dobby had to punish himself, sir. [pushes a stool closer to Harry] Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir.
Harry: Your family?
Dobby: The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. [gets up and sits on the stool] Dobby is bound to serve one family forever. If they knew Dobby was here... [shivers] But Dobby had to come. Dobby has to protect Harry Potter. To warn him. Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year. [Harry looks at him in surprise] There is a plot, a plot to make most terrible things happen.
Harry: What terrible things? Who’s plotting them?
Dobby: [trying to resist himself from saying something] Oh, he! Can’t say!
Harry: Okay, I understand. You can’t say.
Dobby: Don’t make me talk. L-- [Dobby gets on the desk, grabs the lamp and hits himself with it.] Bad Dobby!
Harry: Dobby? Dobby, put the lamp down. [he keeps hitting himself, in the living room, Vernon is still doing his conversation with the Masons.]
Vernon: So, when they arrive at the ninth hole-- [Dobby’s shout is heard, Vernon hears it upstairs while looking suspicious.]
Harry: [trying to grab the lamp from Dobby] Give me the lamp! [Dobby keeps straining until Harry hears Vernon coming upstairs] Dobby, stop! [he finally grabs it from Dobby, grabs his rags, hides him in the closet, and closes the door] Get in there and keep quiet!
Vernon: [opening the door, stomping into the room, and glaring at Harry] What the devil are you doing up here?!
Harry: I was just... [Dobby slowly opens the closet door; Harry pushes it closed]
Vernon: You've just ruined the punchline of my Japanese golfer joke.
Harry: Sorry. [closes the closet door again]
Vernon: [glances at the closet door, unaware of Dobby's presence, then lifts his finger as he turns his eyes back to Harry] One more sound, and you'll wish you'd never been born, boy. [sees the closet door opening again] And fix that door.
Harry: [closing the door again] Yes, sir. [Vernon glares at Harry as he walks out of the room, pulling the door closed; with Vernon gone, Harry opens the closet door to let Dobby out] See why I've got to go back? [Dobby removes a sock from his ear] I don't belong here; I belong in your world, at Hogwarts. [Dobby sniffs the sock and throws it aside and turns to Harry] It's the only place I've got friends.
Dobby: Friends who don't even write to Harry Potter?  Harry: Well, I expect they've been--hang on, how do you know my friends haven't been writing me?
Dobby: Harry Potter mustn't be angry with Dobby. Dobby hoped if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him, Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir...  Harry: Give me those. Now.
Dobby: No!
Harry: Dobby, get back here! Dobby... Please... No  Dobby: Harry Potter must say he's not going back to school.  Harry: I can't. Hogwarts is my home.  Dobby: Then Dobby must do it, sir. For Harry Potter's own good.
Vernon: I'm sorry. It's our nephew. Very disturbed. Meeting strangers upsets him, so we kept him upstairs...
Car Rescue
[Petunia and Dudley watch as Vernon drills bars into Harry's bedroom window.]
Vernon: [after tightening the bars, he glares at Harry, who glares back at him through the window] You're never going back to that school. You're never going to see those freaky friends of yours again. Never!
[Later that evening, as Harry is asleep in bed, he hears what sounds like a car engine outside. Waking up and putting on his glasses, he gets out of bed and walks to the window. Looking out the window, he sees a strange object moving through the sky. As he looks, the object appears to be a shooting star, before turning into two beams of light. A turquoise Ford Anglia car flies to Harry's bedroom window, then turns to the right as Harry and Hedwig silently watch. In the Ford Anglia is Ron, accompanied by his older twins, Fred and George.]
Ron: [looking at Harry through the bars on his window] Hiya, Harry.
Harry: [surprised to see his friends] Ron, Fred, George, what are you all doing here?
Ron: Rescuing you, of course. Now, come on. Get your trunk!
[Eventually, Harry has gotten dressed, packed his Hogwarts trunk with some clothes, his books, pajamas, uniforms, and all other necessities, shuts it closed, and locks it.]
Ron: [putting a hook at the bars on Harry's window] You'd better stand back. [Harry steps back as Ron turns to the twin in the drivers' seat] Let's go!
[The car pulls the bars on Harry’s window off. SMASH! Petunia and Vernon wake up.]
Petunia: Oh!
Vernon: Now, what the hell’s he doing? Potter!
Dudley: [Also awake and on the stairs.] Dad! What’s going on!?
George: Go, go, go, go! 
Dudley: Dad, hurry up! [Camera shows Vernon unlocking the locks on the door on Harry’s bedroom.]
[Harry is putting his trunk on the car.]
Ron: Come on.
Fred: Come on.
Ron: Come on, Harry! Hurry up!
Vernon: Petunia, he’s escaping! [Vernon grabs Harry’s ankle.]
Harry: Ahh- ahh!
Ron: I’ve got you Harry!
Vernon: Come here!
Harry: [struggles to get out of  Vernon’s grip.] Let go of me!
Vernon: Oh no, boy! You and that bloody pigeon aren’t going anywhere!
Harry: Get off!
Ron: Drive!
Fred: Right.
George: Right!
Vernon: No! No! No! No! Aaaah! [Vernon falls Freon the window.]
Dudley: Dad!
Vernon: Oh... Damn. [He lands on the garden.]
[The car flies away.]
Ron: By the way, Harry, Happy Birthday!


The Burrow
[Fred walks to the window and opens it to unlock the door.]
Fred: Come on. Okay, come on. Shhh! Shhh!
[Fred is checking that the coast is clear then beckoning the others inside.]
Fred: Okay, come on
Ron: Do you think it’d be all right if we had some of this?
[George is half smiling.]
George: Yeah, Mum would never know
Ron: It’s not much, but it’s home
Harry: I think it’s...brilliant
[Ron looks up. Sees Harry's mesmerized face. Ron slowly smiles.]
Mrs. Weasley: Where have you been?
[The boys nearly jump out of their skin. Mrs. Weasley stands in the doorway. Furious. She smiles sweetly at Harry.]
Mrs. Weasley: Harry, how wonderful to see you dear
[Mrs. Weasley turns back to Fred, George and Ron.]
Mrs. Weasley: Beds empty! No note! Car gone! You could've died! You could've been seen!
[Mrs. Weasley turns back to Harry.]
Mrs. Weasley: Of  course, I don’t blame you, Harry dear
Ron: They were starving him, Mum! There were bars on his window!
Mrs. Weasley: Well, you’d best hope that I don’t put bars on your window, Ronald Weasley!
[Mrs. Weasley starts softening instantly.]
Mrs. Weasley: Care for a spot of tea, Harry?
[Ginny is walking down the stairs.]
Ginny: Mummy. Have you seen my jumper--
Mrs. Weasley: Yes dear. It was on the cat
[Ginny looked wide eyed at Harry.]
Harry: Hello. W-what did I do?
Ron: Ginny. Been talking about you all summer. Dead annoying, really
[Mr. Weasley comes in.]
Mr. Weasley: Morning, Weasleys
Fred, George and Ron: Morning, Dad
Mrs. Weasley: Morning Arthur!
Mr. Weasley: What a night. Nine raids. Nine!
Harry: (to Ron) Raids?
Ron: Dad works in the Ministry of Magic. In the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office. Dad loves Muggles. Thinks they're fascinating
Mr. Weasley: Well now. Who are you?
Harry: Oh, sorry sir. I’m Harry, sir, Harry Potter
Mr. Weasley: Good Lord, are you really? Ron’s told us all about you, of course. When did he get here?
Mrs. Weasley: (darkly) This morning. Your sons flew that enchanted car of yours to Surrey and back last night
Mr. Weasley: Did you really! How’d it go?!
[Mr. Weasley catches Mrs. Weasley's eye. Fred, George, Ron and Harry are hiding their laughter.]
Fred, George, Ron and Harry: Oh, it...
Mrs. Weasley: Arthur! 
[Everyone except Molly is trying very hard to stop laughing.]
Mr. Weasley: I mean...that was very wrong, indeed, boys. Very wrong of you. Now, Harry, you must know all about Muggles. Tell me, what exactly is the function of a rubber duck?
Harry: Oh, umm...
[An owl, Errol with letters flew in, only to hit a window.]
Mrs. Weasley: Well, that’ll be Errol with the post. Oh, fetch it will you Percy, please?
Percy: Errol...
Ron: He’s always doing that
Percy: Oh look, it’s our Hogwarts letters. And they’ve sent us Harry’s as well
Mr. Weasley: Dumbledore must know you’re here, Harry. Doesn’t miss a trick, that man
Mrs. Weasley: Oh, no
Fred: This lot won’t come cheap, Mum. The spell books alone...
Mrs. Weasley: We’ll manage. Right then. There’s only one place we’re going to get all of this: Diagon Alley.

To Diagon Alley
[Mrs. Weasley picks up a pot of the mantel.]
Mrs. Weasley: You first, Harry dear
[Mrs. Weasley offers Harry a flowerpot. At the bottom is a layer of very soft dust. Harry frowns in confusion.]
Ron: But Harry's never traveled by Floo powder before, Mum
Harry: Floo Powder?
Mrs. Weasley: Oh, well, you go first, Ron. So that Harry can see how it's done. Yes. In you go. That's it
Ron: Diagon Alley!
[Ron disappears.]
Mrs. Weasley: You see? It's quite easy, dear. Don't be afraid. Come on. Come on. In you go. That's it. Mind your head. That's right. Now, take your Floo powder. That's it, very good. Now, don't forget to speak very, very clearly
Harry: Diagonally
[Harry disappears.]
Mrs. Weasley: What did he say, dear?
Mr. Weasley: "Diagonally"
Mrs. Weasley: I thought he did
Borgin and Burkes
[Harry landed in Borgin and Burkes. Harry goes into a cabinet. Draco and Lucius arrives to the store.]
Lucius: Don't touch anything, Draco
Draco: Yes, father
Mr. Borgin: Uh, Mr. Malfoy, what a pleasure to see you again. And young Master Malfoy, too. Delighted. I must show you, just in today and very reasonably--
Lucius: I'm not buying today, Borgin. I'm selling
Mr. Borgin: Selling?
Lucius: Draco
[Draco puts a box on the counter.]
Lucius: You are aware no doubt that the Ministry of Magic is conducting more raids on private houses. There's even rumors of a new Muggle Protection Act
Mr. Borgin: Pure wizard blood is counting for less everywhere, I'm afraid
Lucius: Not with me. Anyway, I brought a few items from home that might prove, uh...
Flourish and Blotts
[A copy of Gilderoy Lockhart's autobiography "Magical Me" is on display as Harry and Hermione enter the store.]
Flying to Hogwarts
[The Ford Anglia is parked at King's Cross Station as numerous people walk past it. In the station, Harry, Ron, Ginny, Percy, Fred, George, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley are desperate to catch the Hogwarts Express before it leaves.]

Mr. Weasley: 10:58. Come on, come on!
Mrs. Weasley: Train will be leaving any moment!
Mr. Weasley: Fred, George, Percy, you first! [Fred pushes his cart through the barrier to Platform 9¾, followed by Percy and George]
Mrs. Weasley: [patting Ginny on the back] Okay. [Ginny pushes her cart and runs through the wall; Mr. and Mrs. Weasley follow]
Mr. Weasley: After you, dear. [Mrs. Weasley disappears through the wall; Mr. Weasley goes in immediately after her]
Mrs. Weasley: [meeting up with Ginny as she stands by the Hogwarts Express, which is just about ready to go] Come on, Ginny. We'll get you a seat. Hurry! [the three run for the train; outside, only Harry and Ron are left]
Harry: [turning to Ron] Let's go.
[Ron nods; then the two boys push their carts directly for the wall. However, instead of going through the wall, Harry inexplicably crashes into it and falls over; Ron loses control of his cart, and falls over as well. A station agent, the same man Harry saw a year ago, notices while speaking to a woman, and approaches Harry and Ron as they get to their feet, groaning from their slight injuries.]

Station Agent: Oy! What do you two think you're doing?
Harry: Sorry. Lo-lost control of the trolley. [the agent shakes his head at them and walks away; Harry glances at Ron] Why can't we get through?
Ron: I don't know. [touching the wall with his hand, discovering the bricks have become solid] The gateway's sealed itself for some reason. [Harry touches the wall to see that it's completely solid]
Harry: [hearing a clock chime, he and Ron look up at a nearby clock displaying the time 11:00] The train leaves at exactly 11:00. We've missed it!
Ron: [glancing at the clock in horror, then turning to Harry] Harry... if we can't get through, maybe mom and dad can't get back.
Harry: [trying to decide what to do about their dilemma] Maybe we should just go and wait by the car.
Ron: [the sound of these words suddenly gives him an idea] The car... [Harry glances at him, wondering what he's got in mind]
Whomping Willow
[As the Ford Anglia flies alongside the Hogwarts Express, it puts on its headlights and flies off. Soon enough, Harry and Ron are flying over the lake, and have arrived at Hogwarts.]

Ron: [glancing at the castle with a smile as he turns to face Harry] Welcome home. [Harry smiles, happy to be back at Hogwarts after such an unpleasant summer]
Not Expelled... Today
[Harry and Ron walk into the Entrance Hall with their belongings and pets, which they leave with the rest of the students' luggage.]

Harry: See you, Hedwig! [he and Ron then run up the steps] So a house-elf shows up in my bedroom, we can't get through the barrier to Platform 9¾, we almost get killed by a tree... clearly someone doesn't want me here this year. [reaching the top of the stairs, they come face-to-face with the caretaker, Argus Filch and his pet cat, Mrs. Norris]
Filch: [glaring at them with a malicious smile] Well, take a good look, lads. This night might well be the last you spend in this castle. [Harry and Ron glance at each other nervously] Oh, dear, we are in trouble. [he smiles more devilishly; moments later, Harry and Ron are standing in Severus Snape's classroom]
Snape: [holding up a newspaper article about their flying car at King's Cross Station] You were seen by no less than seven Muggles! [furiously throws the newspaper aside and glares at them] Do you have any idea how serious this is? You have risked the exposure of our world. Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow that's been on these grounds since before you were born!
Ron: Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us.
Snape: Silence! [walking around his desk towards them] I assure you... that were you in Slytherin and your fate rested with me, the both of you would be on the train home tonight! As it is.
Dumbledore: They are not. [Harry, Ron, Snape, and Filch turn towards the doorway to see Dumbledore standing there, accompanied by his associate, Professor McGonagall. Both of them are looking stern.]
Harry: [glancing at Dumbledore and McGonagall] Professor Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall.
Snape: Headmaster, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry. As such...
Dumbledore: I'm well aware of our bylaws, Severus, having written more than a few myself. However, as Head of Gryffindor House, it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action.
Ron: We'll go and get our stuff.
McGonagall: What are you talking about, Mr. Weasley?
Ron: Well, you're going to expel us, aren't you?
McGonagall: Not today, Mr. Weasley. But I must impress upon both of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be writing to your families tonight. And you will both receive detention.
[Harry and Ron turn back to Snape who casts a glare of pure venom at them]
(Extended Version)

Dumbledore: And now I suggest that we all return to the feast. There is a delicious-looking custard tart that I am most anxious to sample.
[Dumbledore and McGonagall exit the office and Snape follows behind with a disapproving facial expression.
Harry and Ron pass Filch. Harry notices a envelope on the ground and picks it up. It's addressed to Filch and is about the basics of magic.]

Harry: Eh, Mr. Filch, you dropped this.
[Filch eyes the envelope before he grabs it and stuffs it in his pocket fast while looking flabbergasted. Harry and Ron walk on.]


Mandrakes; Ron's Howler
[The next day, the second year students are in the Herbology greenhouses as Professor Sprout enters.]
Professor Sprout: Morning, everyone. [taps the stand to get everyone's attention] Good morning, everyone.
Students: Good morning, Professor Sprout.
Gilderoy Lockhart
[The students are seated in the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom, decorated with portraits of its owner: Gilderoy Lockhart; the door to the office opens and Lockhart walks out.]
Lockhart: Let me introduce you to your new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher: me, Gilderoy Lockhart.
Mudbloods and Murmurs
[Harry is walking down the corridor wearing his Quidditch outfit, accompanied by the rest of the team: Oliver Wood, Fred, George, Angelina Johnson, Alicia Spinnet, and Katie Bell.]
Oliver: I spent the summer devising a whole new Quidditch program. We are going to train earlier, harder, and longer. [glancing to his left, the rest of the team follows his gaze] What...? I don't believe it. [stepping out into the courtyard, they come across the Slytherin Quidditch team, also dressed for Quidditch, as Ron and Hermione are sitting nearby; Oliver directs his attention to the team's captain, Marcus Flint] Where do you think you're going, Flint?
Marcus: Quidditch practice.
Oliver: I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.
Marcus: Easy, Wood. I've got a note. [holds out a rolled up scroll; Wood takes it and opens it]
Ron: Uh-oh. I smell trouble. [he and Hermione get up and walk towards the two teams]
Oliver: [reading the parchment] I, Professor Severus Snape, do hereby give the Slytherin team permission to practice today, owing to the need to train their new Seeker." [looks up from the parchment] You've got a new Seeker, who? [Marcus steps aside, and Draco steps out towards the Gryffindor team members]
Harry: [amazed that his nemesis is now a member of the Slytherin Quidditch team] Malfoy?
Draco: That's right. And that's not all that's new this year. [puts his broom at his side; Harry, Ron, Hermione, and the rest of the Gryffindor Quidditch team examine the brooms Draco and the rest of the Slytherin team are holding]
Ron: Those are Nimbus 2001s. How did you get those?
Marcus: A gift from Draco's father.
Draco: You see, Weasley, unlike some, my father can afford the best.
Hermione: At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in. They got in on pure talent.
[Draco glares at her in annoyance as he takes a few steps and stops only at arms length in front of her]

Draco: No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood.
[Hermione glares at him with a mixture of hate and hurt as Draco sneers.]

Ron: You'll pay for that one, Malfoy! [he takes out his wand and aims it at Draco] Eat slugs!
[Unfortunately, Ron's spell backfires, blasting him off backwards and onto the ground. Harry and Hermione immediately rush to his side.]

Hermione: You okay, Ron? Say something!
[Ron opens his mouth as if to say something, but instead he spits out a slug.]

Colin Creevey: [starts taking pictures of Ron] Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?
Harry: No, Colin! Get out of the way. [he and Hermione help Ron to his feet] Let's take him to Hagrid. [Ron regurgitates another slug] He'll know what to do.
[The three of them rush off to Hagrid's while the Slytherins laugh at them.]

Writing on the Wall
[Harry is walking into the corridor when he suddenly hears the ominous voice again]

Ominous Voice: Blood. I smell blood. Let me rip you... Let me kill you. Kill... kill... kill!
Hermione: [she and Ron just appear out of nowhere] Harry...
Harry: Did you hear it?
Ron: [concerned and confused] Hear what?
Harry: That voice.
Hermione: [getting concerned as well] Voice? What voice?
Harry: I heard it first in Lockhart's office, and then, again, just-- [he hears the voice once more]
Ominous Voice: It's time.
Harry: [getting tense] It's moving. I think it's going to kill.
Ron: [as Harry runs past them down the corridor] "Kill"?
Hermione: [she and Ron run after him] Harry, wait! Not so fast!
[Harry stops in the middle of the corridor, then looks down to see the floor is wet before walking to the right. Ron and Hermione run to catch up with him; they stop abruptly as they see numerous spiders scurrying away through a crack in the window.]

Harry: Strange... I've never seen spiders act like that.
Ron: I don't like spiders. [they then glance at something else on the floor] What's that?
Hermione: [they gaze at a puddle of water, where they can see what appears to be bloody writing, then look up at the wall to see foreboding words written in blood which Hermione reads] "The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Enemies of the Heir, beware." It's written in blood.
Harry: [looks to the left] Oh, no. [Hermione follows Harry's gaze and gasps when she sees what he is seeing; he walks toward a torch on the wall, tied to the torch is Mrs. Norris, frozen and seemingly scared by something] It's Filch's cat. It's Mrs. Norris. [behind them, Percy walks into the corridor, leading the other Gryffindor house students]
[Soon enough, the corridor fills with students, who gaze at the bloody writing and Mrs. Norris, Madame Pomfrey expresses horror and shock; Colin gets his camera ready, but Percy stops him.]

Draco: "Enemies of the Heir, beware." [glances at the Gryffindor house students] You'll be next, Mudbloods. [Ron scowls and glares at him]
Filch: What's going on here? [pushing his way through the crowd] Go on, make way, make way. [glares at Harry] Potter... what are you...? [gazes past Harry at the frozen form of his cat and trembles] Mrs. Norris? [glares at Harry again] You murdered my cat.
Harry: No. No.
Filch: [as Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle grin] I'll kill you. [smiles wickedly at Harry then grabs him by the shirt] I'll kill you!
Dumbledore: Argus? [Filch lets go of Harry; the students step aside as Professors Dumbledore, McGonagall, and Snape arrive on the scene] Argus, I... [he glances at the writing on the wall] Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately. [the students turn to leave; Harry, Ron, and Hermione follow] Everyone except [Harry, Ron, and Hermione stop] you three. [they turn to face him]
Ravenclaw Prefect: Ravenclaws, follow me.
Dumbledore: She's not dead, Argus. [Filch trembles, presumably from relief and confusion] She has been petrified.
Lockhart: Ah. Thought so. So unlucky I wasn't there. I know exactly the countercurse that could've spared her.
Dumbledore: [smiles and nods] But how she has been petrified I cannot say.
Filch: [gesturing towards Harry] Ask him. It's him that done it. You saw what he wrote on the wall.
Harry: It's not true, sir. I swear. I never touched Mrs. Norris.
Filch: Rubbish.
Snape: If I might, headmaster. Perhaps Potter and his friends were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. However, the circumstances are suspicious. I for one don't recall seeing Potter at dinner.
Lockhart: I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus. You see, Harry was helping me answer my fanmail.
Hermione: That's why Ron and I went looking for him, Professor. We just found him when he said... [looks at Harry]
Snape: Yes, Ms. Granger?
Harry: When I said I wasn't hungry. [Snape turns towards him] We were heading back to the common room when we found Mrs. Norris. [Snape turns towards Professor Dumbledore]
Dumbledore: Innocent until proven guilty, Severus.
Filch: [as Snape smiles slightly] My cat has been petrified. I want to see some punishment!
Dumbledore: We will be able to cure her, Argus. As I understand it, Madame Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrakes. When matured, a potion will be made, which will revive Mrs. Norris. [Filch trembles] And in the meantime, I strongly recommend caution... to all.
[Harry, Ron, and Hermione nod. Moments later, they are walking along the Grand Staircase, as the numerous staircases change.]

Hermione: [as they ascend the stairs] It's a bit strange isn't it?
Harry: "Strange"?
Hermione: [turns to face him] You hear this voice, a voice only you can hear, and then Mrs. Norris turns up petrified. It's just... strange.
Harry: You think I should've told them, Dumbledore and the others, I mean?
Ron: Are you mad?
Hermione: No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't a good sign. [turns and walks along]
Man in Painting: She's right, you know. [Harry and Ron glance at him, then walk along]
About the Chamber
McGonagall: [at Transfiguration class the next day] Could I have your attention, please? Right. Now, today, we will be transforming animals into water goblets. [Draco shrugs] Like so. [turns to a bird resting on a post to her right, tapping it with her wand as she speaks] One, two, three, Vera Verto. [a stream of magic emits from her wand, and the bird becomes a goblet; the other students express amazement] Now it's your turn? Who would like to go first? [approaches Ron] Ah! Mr. Weasley. One, two, three, Vera Verto.
Ron: Ahem! [silently taps his wand towards Scabbers three times] Vera Verto. [his wand causes Scabbers to turn into a furry goblet with his tail moving around while squeaking; Harry and some of the other students grin and laugh]
McGonagall: [as Ron picks up the Scabbers-goblet] That wand needs replacing, Mr. Weasley. [Hermione raises her hand] Yes, Ms. Granger?
Hermione: Professor, I was wondering if you could tell us about the Chamber of Secrets. [Draco gives Hermione a surprised look]
McGonagall: [glancing around the room and seeing that the students look somewhat interested] Very well. Well, you all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. Now three of the founders coexisted quite harmoniously. One did not.
Ron: [turns to Harry] Three guesses who.
McGonagall: Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. In other words, pure-bloods. [Hermione and Draco glare at each other] Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school. Now, according to legend, Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle, known as the Chamber of Secrets. Well, shortly before departing, he sealed it, until that time when his own true heir returned to the school. The Heir alone would be able to open the Chamber, and unleash the horror within, and by so doing, purge the school of all those who, in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic.
Hermione: Muggle-borns. [Professor McGonagall points her wand at her in an affirmative gesture]
McGonagall: Well, naturally the school has been searched many times. No such Chamber has been found. [turns and walks back to her desk]
Hermione: Professor, [Professor McGonagall turns around] what exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?
 McGonagall: Well, the Chamber is said to be home to something that only the Heir of Slytherin can control. It is said to be the home of a monster. [Hermione feels a sense of dread at these words; a horrified Ron turns around to look at Draco, who grins smugly at him]
Ron: [as he, Harry, and Hermione walk down the corridor] Do you think it's true? Do you really think there is a Chamber of Secrets?
Hermione: Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's worried. All the teachers are.
Harry: [as Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle walk down the corridor behind them] But if there really is a Chamber of Secrets, and it really has been opened, then that means...
Hermione: The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?
Ron: [as Draco and Goyle walk past them, with Crabbe running to keep up] Let's think... [glances at their adversaries as they pass] who do we know who thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?
Hermione: If you're talking about Malfoy...
Ron: Of course! You heard him: "You'll be next, mudbloods."
Hermione: I heard him. But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?
Harry: Well, maybe Ron's right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family, the whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries.
Ron: Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe we could trick them into telling.
Hermione: Even they aren't that thick. But there might be another way. Mind you, it would be difficult, not to mention, we'd be breaking fifty school rules, and it'll be dangerous, very dangerous.
Rogue bludger
[In the library, Hermione pulls a book titled "Most Potente Potions" off the shelf, then walks a few rows to where Harry and Ron are.]
Hermione: Here it is, the Polyjuice Potion. [reads from the book] "Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another."
Ron: You mean, if Harry and I drink that stuff, we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?
Hermione: Yes.
Ron: [he and Harry exchange grins] Wicked. Malfoy will tell us anything.
Hermione: [smiles slightly at their motivation] Exactly, but it's tricky. [glancing at the book again] I've never seen a more complicated potion.
Harry: Well, how long will it take to make?
Hermione: [looking up at Harry] A month.
Harry: A month?! But, Hermione... if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin, he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then!
Hermione: I know, but it's the only plan we've got.
No longer safe
[Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid run to Harry as Lockhart runs to him followed by another group of students.]
Harry: [as his friends reach him] Thank you.
Hermione: Are you okay?
Harry: No. I think my... I think my arm's broken.
Lockhart: [kneeling down beside Harry] Not to worry, Harry. I will fix that arm of yours straight away.
Harry: No. Not you.
Dueling Club
[Harry lays in bed, shocked by what he just heard. A few days later, in the girls' bathroom, he tells Ron and Hermione what he overheard.]
Hermione: "Again"? You mean, the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?


A Parselmouth
[Snape pulls Draco to his feet and pushes him forward.]
Lockhart: [as Draco raises his wand] I said disarm only!
Draco: Serpensortia! [swishes his wand and fires a cobra out of it; which then slithers along the playing field; Harry lowers his wand]
Snape: [walking past Draco towards the snake] Don't move, Potter. I'll get rid of it for you.
Lockhart: Allow me, Professor Snape. [Snape stops in his tracks] Alarte ascendare! [the snake jettisons high into the air, then falls back down, raises its head and turns toward Harry with a hiss]
Harry: Sya- hassa- she. (Leave them alone.) [the snake turns toward Justin Finch-Fletchey and hisses] Sya- hasi- heth. (Leave him alone.) [Snape watches suspiciously] Sya- hasi- heth. [the snake turns toward Harry again]

Snape: Vipera. Evanesca. [He waves his wand, emitting a blast at the snake, causing it to burst into flame and disappear. A murmur runs through the audience.]

Justin Finch-Fletchney: What are you playing at?!
Nothing to tell
[Harry turns a corner and discovers Nearly Headless Nick, petrified with his head partially detached and floating in place. On the floor just a few feet away is Justin Finch-Fletchey, also petrified. Harry kneels down to examine his stiff body. As he does so, Filch walks out of a doorway behind him.]
Filch: Caught in the act. [Harry turns around at the sound of his voice] I'll have you out this time, Potter. Mark my words. [grins wickedly and walks away]
Harry: No, Mr. Filch! Y-y-you don't understand-- [breaks off as something else catches his eye; he looks to see another group of spiders scurrying away over the wall and out a window; as he walks to the window, watching the spiders, Filch returns, accompanied by Professor McGonagall; she gasps in shock at the sight of Justin and approaches him, then glances from his body to Harry] Professor. I swear, I didn't.
Professor McGonagall: This is out of my hands, Potter. [she and Harry then walk to an opening containing a griffin statue, the entrance to Professor Dumbledore's office] Professor Dumbledore will be waiting for you. [she gestures towards the statue; Harry approaches] Sherbet Lemon. [she opens her hands at the statue; the statue rotates clockwise and rises, and a staircase comes out of the floor, also rising in a clockwise fashion; Harry steps onto the staircase, stepping towards a door as the statue comes to a stop]
Polyjuice Potion
[It is Christmas, and students going home for the holidays are transported across the frozen lake in sleighs pulled by white horses.]
Harry and Ron Transformed
[Harry and Ron walk down a staircase to a corridor.]
The Diary
[A thunderclap illuminates the dark sky outside.]
Tom Riddle
[Harry materializes in the Hogwarts Entrance Hall, which doesn't look any different than in the present.]
Petrified
Harry: It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago.
Cornelius Fudge
[Harry and Ron, under the Invisibility Cloak, approach Hagrid's cabin at night. They knock at the door; Fang looks up, Hagrid puts the lid on his teapot and readies his crossbow.]
Hagrid: Who's there? [walking to his front door and gently kicking it open] Hello? Hello? [Harry and Ron remove the cloak, Hagrid lowers it at the sight of them]
Harry: What's that for?
Hagrid: Oh, nothing, I was expecting, uh... it doesn't matter. Come on in, I just made a pot of tea. [he pours tea into a cup all the way to the brim]
Harry: Hagrid, are you okay?
Hagrid: I'm fine. I'm all right. [puts the teapot down]
Harry: Di-did you hear about Hermione?
Hagrid: Oh yeah. I heard about that all right.
Harry: Look, we have to ask you something. Do you know who's opened the Chamber of Secrets?
Hagrid: What you have to understand about that is... [there is another knock at the door; Harry and Ron turn towards the door as Fang barks] [whispering] Quick. Under the cloak. Don't say a word, be quiet, both of you. [Harry and Ron go into a corner, where Ron throws the cloak back over them; Hagrid pushes open the door, to find Dumbledore at the door, accompanied by another older gentleman, Cornelius Fudge] Oh, Professor Dumbledore, sir.
Professor Dumbledore: [as Fudge gives Hagrid a slight greeting smile] Good evening, Hagrid. I wonder, could we...?
Hagrid: Of course. [beckons them] Come in, come in.
Ron: [recognizes Fudge as he enters and whispers] That's dad's boss, Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic.
Aragog
[Harry and Ron exit the cabin and glance to their left at the window, to see the spiders scurrying out the window, down the side of the house, towards the Forbidden Forest.]
Harry: Come on.
Ron: [fearfully] What?
Harry: You heard what Hagrid said: "Follow the spiders."
Ron: They're heading to the Dark Forest! [Harry walks towards the forest, carrying Hagrid's lantern; Ron reluctantly follows] Why spiders? Why couldn't it be "follow the butterflies"? Harry, I don't like this. Harry, I don't like this at all.

Harry: Shush!

Ron: Can we go back now?
Spider attack
[Numerous spiders are descending from a massive hive high above towards Harry and Ron.]
Harry: [glancing at Aragog again] Well... thank you. We'll just... go.
Aragog: Go? [Ron nods fearfully] I think not. [more spiders emerge from around him] My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid on my command. But I cannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into our midst. [as hundreds more spiders appear from the trees] Goodbye, friend of Hagrid.
Ron: [glancing at Harry in terror] Can we panic now? [a big spider lands right next to the boys; Ron points his wand at it in fear, while Harry swings the lantern at it, then at another spider before throwing the lantern to the ground and taking out his wand before he and Ron stand back to back as the spiders surround them] Know any spells?
Harry: One, but it's not powerful enough for all of them.
Ron: Where's Hermione when you need her?
[The spiders inch closer to the boys. At the moment, the sound of a car engine is heard; Harry and Ron look in the direction of the noise, to see the Ford Anglia drive into Aragog's nest, towards them; they back away towards Aragog as the car comes to a stop, then opens its doors for them.]
Harry: Let's go! [they run for the car; a pair of spiders come in for the attack; Ron whimpers as he gets in on the driver's side, closing the door on a spider's leg, but manages to pull itself free; Harry points his wand at the other spider as he reaches the passenger's door] Arania Exumai! [a beam emits from his wand, blasting the spider away; Harry gets in the car and closes the door, one spider lands on top of the car, while another lands on the hood] Go!
[Ron puts the car in reverse, and it backs away as fast as it can, as they go under a tree root, the spider on the roof falls off onto its back. The car then goes flying backwards over a hill.]
Harry and Ron: Whoa! [as the car lands on the forest floor, the spider on the hood falls off; the car then comes to a stop]
Ron: [grips the steering wheel, then turns to face Harry] Glad we're out of there.
[Suddenly, another spider climbs onto the car, and sticks its head through the window; Harry jumps as the spider goes for Ron, putting its pincers around his neck; taking his hands off the steering wheel, Ron tries to get the spider off, squirming and screaming. Harry calmly reaches into his pocket and pulls out his wand, and points it at his frightened friend. Ron, his eyes and nostrils wide with terror, moves to the left, giving Harry a clear shot at the spider trying to eat him.]
Harry: Arania Exumai! [a beam of white light emits from Harry's wand, blasting the spider off Ron and away from the car]
Ron: [glancing out the window and turning to Harry again] Thanks for that.
Harry: [putting his wand back in his pocket] Don't mention it. [looks out the windshield as a twitching sound is heard and squints; the spiders appear at the top of the hill, and begin moving towards the car; seeing the spiders, Ron whimpers] Get us out of here. Now! [Ron puts the car in reverse] Come on! Come on, move faster! [the boys scream as Ron makes a sharp turn] Come on, go! [Ron puts the car in drive, and steps on the gas; as they drive through the forest, the spiders pursue the car, moving almost as fast as cheetahs] Get us in the air.
Ron: [pushing the gear] The flying gear's jammed! [the spiders gather at a tree branch up ahead, intent on intercepting the Ford Anglia]
Harry: Come on. Pull!
Ron: I'm trying!
[As they drive into the pack of spiders, knocking them aside, the car takes the air, with one spider managing to grab hold of the car before falling to the ground. Flying over the trees, the car descends and lands a few feet from Hagrid's house before coming to a complete stop in front of the house; Harry opens his car door and lets Fang out.]
Ron: [evidently furious that Hagrid had to put them in such danger] "Follow the spiders". "Follow the spiders"! If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban, I'll kill him. [the Ford Anglia backs up as Fang reenters Hagrid's house, then drives past Harry and Ron, and back into the forest again] I mean, what was the point of sending us in there? What have we found out?
Harry: We know one thing: Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets; he was innocent.
Missing
[The next day, Harry and Ron are visiting Hermione in the Hospital Wing again; Harry takes the old dried up flowers out of the vase next to Hermione's bed, puts in some new white flowers (most likely roses), then sits on the bed.]
Harry: Wish you were here, Hermione. We need you. Now more than ever.
[Hermione just lays there with her glossy facial expression as Ron sighs sadly. Harry rubs Hermione's left hand; feeling something in it, he looks down and removes his hand to discover a crumpled up piece of paper, a library book page, which he carefully removes and straightens out.]
Ron: [glancing at the page] What's that?
Harry: [examining the page] Ron, this is why Hermione was in the library the day she was attacked. [glances at the page and then back at Ron as he gets up] Come on! [Harry and Ron walk through the corridor as Harry reads from the page] "Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the Basilisk. Capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye. Spiders flee before it..." [looking up at Ron] Ron, this is it. The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a Basilisk. That's why I can hear it speak. It's a snake.
Ron: [processing the information they just read] But if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no one's dead?
Harry: [thinking for a few seconds then looking at the window] Because no one did look it in the eye. Not directly, at least. [they walk along as they go over how each of the victims were petrified] Colin saw it through his camera. Justin... Justin must've seen the Basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick. Nick got the full blast of it, but he's a ghost. He couldn't die again. And Hermione... had the mirror. I bet you anything she was using it to look around corners in case it came along.
Ron: And Mrs. Norris? I'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror, Harry.
Harry: [thinking about how Mrs. Norris got petrified, then remembering] The water... There was water on the floor that night. She only saw the Basilisk's reflection. [Ron nods; Harry takes another look at the page, then walks to a nearby torch to more easily read the page, running his finger along it as he reads] "Spiders flee before it." It all fits.
Ron: But how's the Basilisk been getting around? A dirty great snake, someone would've seen it.
Harry: [as he and Ron glance at the bottom of the page where the word "Pipes" is written] Hermione's answered that, too.
Ron: Pipes? It's using the plumbing!
Harry: Remember what Aragog said about that girl fifty years ago, she died in a bathroom? What if she never left?
Ron: Moaning Myrtle. [Harry nods]
Professor McGonagall: [on the speakers] All students are to return to their house dormitories at once. [Ron glances at Harry in surprise, wondering what could be going on now] All teachers to the second floor corridor immediately.
[Harry and Ron hurry to the second floor corridor. In the section where the bloody message is, Professors McGonagall, Snape, Flitwick, Madam Pomfrey, and Filch run up to the wall, where Professor McGonagall directs their attention to a newly written message.]
Professor McGonagall: As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin has left another message. [Harry and Ron walk into the corridor behind them] Our worst fear has been realized, a student has been taken by the monster, into the Chamber itself. [sadly looks at the others] The students must be sent home. I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.
Lockhart: [happily walking up to the group] So sorry. Dozed off. What have I missed? [grins at Snape and McGonagall]
Snape: A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment has come at last.
Lockhart: [slightly stunned] My... moment?
Snape: Weren't you saying just last night you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is? [Lockhart looks bewildered]
Professor McGonagall: That's settled. We'll leave you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy. Your skills, after all, are legend.
Lockhart: Very well. I'll just be in my office, getting, uh... getting ready. [turns and walks away; Filch watches him, then glances at Madam Pomfrey and Professor McGonagall]
Madam Pomfrey: Who is it that the monster's taken, Minerva?
Professor McGonagall: [glances at her] Ginny Weasley. [Harry and Ron straighten up in shock; Ron quavers slightly]
[Professor McGonagall sadly walks away, along with the other staff; a second later, Snape follows them, revealing the newly written message, which reads "Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever".]
Ron: [reads the message with dread in his voice] "Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever." [Harry looks at Ron as he's becoming all the more devastated by his sister's abduction] Ginny...
Chamber of Secrets
Harry: [as he and Ron race into the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom and up the stairs to Lockhart’s office] Lockhart may be useless, but he’s going to try to get into the Chamber. At least we can tell him what we know! [opening the door to the office and stepping inside] Professor, we have some information for you. [Lockhart stuffs some clothes into his trunk, which he closes as he turns toward them; Ron scowls at him] Are you going somewhere?
Lockhart: Um... well, yes. Urgent call. Unavoidable. Uh, got to go.
Ron: [outraged] What about my sister?!
Lockhart: Uh, well, um... As to that, most unfortunate. No one regrets more than I.
Ron: [in disbelief] You’re the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. You can’t go now!
Lockhart: [as he stuffs his things in his handbag then moves around his desk] Well, I must say, when I took the job, there was nothing in the job description about--
Harry: [blocking his path] You're running away? After all that stuff you did in your books?!
Lockhart: Books can be misleading.
Harry: You wrote them!
Lockhart: [placing his bag on his desk] My dear boy, do use your common sense! My books wouldn't have sold half as well if people didn't think I'd done all those things!
Harry: [staring at Lockhart] You're a fraud. You've just been taking credit for what other wizards have done!
Ron: [as Lockhart directs his attention to him] Is there anything you can do?
Lockhart: Yes. Now you mention it. I'm rather gifted with memory charms. Otherwise, you see, all those wizards would've gone blabbing, and I'd never have sold another book. [Harry and Ron look at each other as Lockhart walks toward his suitcase] In fact, uh... I'm uh... [Ron nods at Harry, and they both reach into their robes to pull out their wands] going to have to do the same to you. [he collects his wand from the suitcase, but Harry and Ron already have their wands trained on him]
Harry: Don't even think about it. [points downward, gesturing for Lockhart to drop his wand; Lockhart reluctantly does so]
[In her bathroom, Moaning Myrtle is floating around crying as Harry, Ron, and Lockhart enter.]
Myrtle: Oh? Who's there? [seeing Harry, she smiles warmly at him] Oh, hello, Harry. What do you want?
Harry: To ask you how you died.
Myrtle: [smiles slightly] Oh... [her smile fades] ...it was dreadful. It happened right here in this very cubicle. I'd hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses. I was crying, and then... I heard somebody come in.
Harry: Who was it, Myrtle?
Myrtle: [choked up] I don't know. I was distraught! [floats towards the three] But they said something funny, a kind of made-up language, and I realized it was a boy speaking, so I unlocked the door to tell him to go away, and... I died.
Harry: Just like that? How?
Myrtle: I just remember seeing a pair of great big yellow eyes, over there, by that sink. [points at the circle of sinks in the center of the bathroom]
[As Myrtle floats off to the stalls, Harry steps forward to examine the sinks. Reaching up to the circular stone above the sinks, he moves his hand downward to the sink in front of him; he turns the tap, but no water comes out. At that second, something else catches his eye; looking more closely at the tap, he sees a snake carved on it.]
Harry: This is it. [taking a step back] This is it, Ron. I think this is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets. [Lockhart glances at the sink in surprise]
Ron: Say something. Harry, say something in Parseltongue.
Harry: [after a few seconds] Hesha- Hassah. (Open up.)
[The circular stone above the sinks rises, then all the sinks begin to move outwards. Harry, Ron, and Lockhart back away slowly as the sinks move; the sink with the snake carved on its tap descends into the floor, then a grating slides over it. Lockhart steps towards the opening that the sinks concealed and looks down into a very wide black hole]
Lockhart: [inhales then turns to Harry with a grin] Excellent, Harry. Ah, good work. Well, then, I'll just be, uh... there's no need for me to stay. [he tries to run, but Harry and Ron grab hold of him]
Harry: Oh, yes there is! [with all their might, they push Lockhart backwards toward the passage before drawing their wands] You first.
Lockhart: Now, boys, what good will it do?
Ron: Better you than us. [Harry nods]
Lockhart: Um, but... obviously, yes. [he nervously turns around and grips the sinks as he looks down into the passage before glancing over his shoulder at the boys again] Sure you don't want to test it first? [annoyed, Ron pokes Lockhart with his wand, sending him into the passage, screaming as he disappears into the darkness; a second later, a crash is heard as Harry and Ron walk up to the opening] It's really quite filthy down here.
Harry: All right. [turns to Ron] Let's go. [Ron nods in agreement]
Myrtle: Oh, Harry? [the two boys look up at her] If you die down there, you're welcome to share my toilet. [she giggles; making Ron uneasy]
Harry: Uh... thanks, Myrtle. [smiles at her, then turns to the opening, and jumps into it; Ron immediately jumps in after him]
[Harry and Ron scream as they go down a slide, which leads to a small pit filled with animal bones, most likely the Basilisk's feeding area, as Lockhart brushes the dirt off his robes when the boys land. They immediately get to feet and point their wands at him.]
Ron: [glancing at the muck around them] Ugh.
Harry: [stepping on the bones] Now, remember: any sign of movement, close your eyes straight away. [he turns and goes into the passageway behind him]
Ron: Go on. [Lockhart reluctantly follows Harry into the passage with Ron right behind him]
Backfire
Harry: [coming to another passageway to the right, he beckons Ron and Lockhart to follow him] This way. [the three walk into a cavern-like room with a massive and lengthy snakeskin on the floor]

Ron: [as Harry walks along the snakeskin] What's this?
Lockhart: [feeling nervous] It looks like a... snake.
Harry: [as he examines it] It's a snakeskin.
Ron: Bloody hell. Whatever shed this must be sixty feet long. Or more. [Lockhart faints, most likely from fear] [sarcastically as Harry turns his attention to Lockhart] Heart of a lion, this one.
Lockhart: [suddenly grabbing Ron's wand and getting to his feet while breathing wickedly and pointing the wand at Harry] The adventure ends here, boys. But don't fret. The world will know our story. How I was too late to save the girl, [points the wand at Ron] how you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body. So... [points the wand at Harry again] ...you first, Mr. Potter. Say good-bye to your memories. [waves the wand wildly as he shouts] Obliviate!
[The wand emits green light, causing Lockhart to fly backwards, slam into the wall, then fall to the floor. A couple seconds later, a rumbling begins, then rocks begin to fall from the ceiling; Harry takes cover as huge rocks go flying over him while Ron backs up against the wall as the rocks form a massive pile.]
Ron: [coughing from the dust produced by the rocks] Harry! [Harry pulls his robe free from one of the rocks] Harry!
Harry: [running to a opening in the big pile of rocks separating him from Ron] Ron! Ron, are you okay?
Ron: I'm fine!
Lockhart: [groans and sits up] Hello. Who are you?
Ron: Um... Ron Weasley.
Lockhart: Really? And, uh... who-who am I?
Ron: [realizing Lockhart has erased his own memory by accident, he turns toward Harry again] Lockhart's memory charm backfired! He hasn't got a clue who he is!
Lockhart: [picks up a small rock as Harry watches through the opening] It's an odd sort of place this is, isn't it? [tosses the rock in his hand then glances at Ron] Do you live here?
Ron: [taking the rock from Lockhart] No.
Lockhart: Really? [Ron smacks Lockhart on the back of the head with the rock, knocking him out; Harry winks slightly]
Ron: [glancing at Harry through the opening again] What do I do now?
Harry: You wait here, and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through. I'll go on and find Ginny.
Ron: [as Harry turns and climbs down from the pile of rocks] Okay.
[Harry draws his wand as he steps onto the floor again and walks forward. Up ahead, he sees a circular door with seven snake-shaped locks on it, and steps towards it.]
Harry: Hesha- Hassah. (Open.)
[An eighth snake slithers out from the door's mechanical hinge, and slithers along the door's edge, causing the other seven snakes to retract one by one. As the snake slithers back into the hinge, the door slowly opens. Harry steps forward; on the other side is the Chamber of Secrets. Harry cautiously steps through the door, into the Chamber, towards the ladder in the doorway.]
Heir of Slytherin
[As the door slowly closes behind him, Harry climbs down the ladder and walks down the corridor. Looking ahead, he sees Ginny lying motionless at the end of the Chamber.]
Harry: Ginny. [runs to her, drops his wand and gets on his knees] Ginny. No, Ginny. Please don’t be dead. Wake up. Wake up! Please wake up.
[Suddenly, Tom Riddle walks out of a nearby doorway.]
Riddle: She won’t wake.
[Harry recognizes his voice and turns toward him. Riddle walks to him.]
Harry: Tom? Tom Riddle? What do you mean she won’t wake? She’s not...?
Riddle: She’s still alive, but only just.
Harry: Are you a ghost?
Riddle: A memory, preserved in a diary for fifty years.
Harry: [reaches out and touches Ginny] She's as cold as ice. Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up. [while Harry's not looking, Riddle bends down and picks up Harry's wand from where he left it] You've got to help me, Tom. There's a Basilisk. 
Riddle: It won't come until it's called. 
Harry: [looks up to see Riddle holding his wand and stands up] Give me my wand, Tom.
Riddle: You won't be needing it.
Harry: Listen, we've got to go. We've got to save her!
Riddle: I'm afraid I can't do that, Harry. You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker, I grow stronger. [Harry looks at him, confused] Yes, Harry. It was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets. [Ginny is shown standing in front of the sink in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom as it opens]
Harry: No. She couldn't. She wouldn't.
Riddle: It was Ginny who set the Basilisk on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat, Ginny who wrote the threatening messages on the walls. [Ginny is show using her blood-covered fingers to write on the wall]
Harry: But why?
Riddle: Because I told her to. You'll find I can be very persuasive. Not that she knew what she was doing. She was, shall we say, in a kind of trance. [as Ginny is shown running into a stall and throwing the diary into the toilet] Still, the power of the diary began to scare her. And she tried to dispose of it in the girls' bathroom. And then, who should find it but you? The very person I was most anxious to meet.
Harry: [stands in front of the Slytherin statue] And why did you want to meet me?
Riddle: I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf Hagrid to gain your trust.
Harry: [angrily] Hagrid's my friend! [calms down slightly] And you framed him, didn't you?
Riddle: It was my word against Hagrid's. Only Dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent.
Harry: [smirks at him] I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.
Riddle: He certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that. [walks around Harry as he speaks] I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school, so I decided to leave behind a diary, preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day, I would be able to lead another, to finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work.
Harry: Well, you haven't finished it this time. In a few hours, the Mandrake draught will be ready. And everyone who was Petrified will be all right again.
Riddle: [smiles maliciously] Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore. For many months now, my new target has been you. [Harry looks at him in surprise] How is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape [pushes Harry's hair aside with his wand to see his scar] with nothing but a scar while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed?
Harry: Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.
Riddle: [smiles wickedly] Voldemort is... my past, present, and future. [turns toward the statue and uses Harry's wand to write his full name in flaming letters; after writing the "E", he flicks the wand, and the letters rearrange themselves to say "I AM LORD VOLDEMORT]
Harry: [as the letters fade and Riddle turns to face him] You. You're the Heir of Slytherin. [Riddle stares evilly at Harry] You're Voldemort.
Riddle: Surely, you didn't think I was going to keep my filthy Muggle father's name? No. I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world!
Harry: Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!
Riddle: Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me!
Harry: He'll never be gone! Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him! [Harry and Riddle glare at each other; a musical sound is heard nearby; Harry and Riddle look down the corridor to see Fawkes flying towards them, carrying something] Fawkes? [Fawkes drops a bundled-up object into Harry's hands as he flies over and around them, then back down the corridor; Harry unrolls the object, which turns out to be the Sorting Hat]
Riddle: So this is what Dumbledore sends his great defender: A songbird and an old hat. [backs away from Harry as he continues examining the Sorting Hat, then walks toward the Slytherin statue and extends his left hand] Shearhas- Samnathas- Sélithaeine. (Speak to me, Slytherin, greatest of the Hogwarts four.) 
The Basilisk
[Harry turns to face the statue of Salazar Slytherin as a rumbling begins; Riddle turns around to face him as the statue's mouth starts to open.]
Riddle: Let's match the power of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against the famous Harry Potter.
[Harry gulps and turns toward the statue again as he hears an ominous snarling that appears to be coming from inside the statue and hyperventilates; Riddle turns to face the statue's mouth as the Basilisk shrieks "Hungry!" from within the statue. The stone slab concealing the statue's mouth stops descending; a split second afterwards, the Basilisk emerges from the darkness and starts to come into the light, growling menacingly. Harry throws the Sorting Hat onto the floor in front of Ginny and races back towards the door to the Chamber as the Basilisk's head comes out of the statue's mouth and its snake-like body lowers into the surrounding water; Riddle, immune to the Basilisk's lethal gaze, watches the creature.]
Riddle: Sethae- He- This! (Kill him!) [turns his attention to the fleeing Harry as the Basilisk's body curves to its right behind it] Parseltongue won't save you now, Potter. [the Basilisk's tail drops into the water behind him] It only obeys me! 
[The Basilisk slithers after Harry with a ferocious growl. Harry races down the corridor as fast as he can while the Basilisk is in hot pursuit; unfortunately, Harry loses his footing on the slippery floor and trips, allowing the Basilisk to catch up with him. His glasses clatter to the floor in front of him; he immediately puts them back on before realizing the Basilisk is right above him and covers his head with his hands. Just as the Basilisk is about to attack Harry, Fawkes emits his cry, getting their attention. Fawkes swoops down, going directly for the Basilisk, and attacks the colossal snake, pecking at it, with Harry observing their fight by watching their shadows on the wall.]
Riddle: No! Your bird may have blinded the Basilisk, but it can still hear you.
[Harry turns around to see that the Basilisk's yellow eyes are bloody. The Basilisk thrashes around furiously as Fawkes flies off; Harry gets to his feet, and steps backwards, stepping into something slimy, causing a splattering sound; Harry looks down to see what he stepped in. At the same time, the Basilisk stops thrashing about and blindly glares at Harry, who looks up again and makes a run for a passageway to his right. The Basilisk lunges at Harry, nearly getting him. Harry, breathing heavily, runs as fast as he can, into a tunnel just to his left as the Basilisk lunges at him again, smashing through a stalactite. Harry runs through the tunnel, looking back to see if the Basilisk is still behind him; he turns left into an alcove, only to find his path blocked by a grate. He struggles to move it, but turns around upon hearing the Basilisk coming into the tunnel. He steps back against the grate, as the Basilisk comes to his position. The Basilisk hisses at him and approaches him with its mouth open. Harry picks up a rock at his feet and throws it; the sound of the rock distracts the Basilisk, who slithers off into another passageway. Harry races back into the Chamber where Riddle and Ginny are.]
Riddle: Yes, Potter. The process is nearly complete. [Harry puts his hand on Ginny's hand again] In a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be dead, and I will cease to be a memory. [Harry looks up at him] Lord Voldemort will return... very... much... alive.
Harry: [glancing at Ginny again] Ginny...
[The Basilisk bursts out of the water surrounding the Slytherin statue and thrashes about; Harry turns toward the Sorting Hat, where a sword magically appears. Harry, without hesitation, grabs the sword and holds it up defensively as the Basilisk slithers toward him. Harry races for the statue and begins to climb it; the Basilisk blindly follows Harry's movements, using its tongue to track his location and lifts its body off the floor. The Basilisk uses its tongue again to find Harry's current position directly in front of it; Harry swings the sword at the Basilisk; it lunges directly at him, he dodges, and it smashes right into the statue. Harry climbs higher as the Basilisk lunges at him again, missing again; Harry climbs onto the top of the statue's head, the Basilisk lunges at Harry repeatedly as he swings the sword wildly at the creature. Eventually, the Basilisk sends Harry rolling down the side of the statue, causing him to lose the sword.]
Harry: [seeing the sword about to slide off the top of the statue's head] No.
[Harry hurries to retrieve the sword; the Basilisk lunges right at Harry once more. Harry stops the sword just in time, and rams it right through the Basilisk's upper jaw. The Basilisk bellows in pain until Harry pulls the sword out. Harry screams in pain as one of the Basilisk's venomous fangs just fell into his arm; he pulls the fang out, unfortunately, the venom is already in his bloodstream. The Basilisk thrashes around, roaring and bellowing in pain, collapsing under its weight, and falls backwards to the floor, dead, splashing water everywhere; Riddle stares at the Basilisk's corpse in disbelief.]
Healing Powers
[Harry limps past the Basilisk's corpse, and, dropping the sword and falling to his knees, he crawls towards Ginny once more as Riddle walks toward them.]
Riddle: Remarkable, isn't it? How quickly the venom of the Basilisk penetrates the body. I guess you have little more than a minute to live. You'll be with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry. [Harry extends his left hand to Ginny's again] Funny... the damage a silly little book can do... especially in the hands of a silly little girl. [Harry looks to the diary in Ginny's arm and carefully pulls it out, placing it on the floor between her and the Basilisk fang] What are you doing? [Harry picks up the Basilisk fang and holds it up while staring at Riddle, who immediately realizes what Harry is about to do] Stop. No!
[Harry stabs one of the diary's pages with the fang as Riddle steps forward to try and stop him; Riddle's body crumbles and gives a discharge of yellow light; ink starts to ooze from the diary, Riddle recoils and growls with rage; Harry pries the fang out. Riddle attempts to attack, but Harry stabs the other page, crippling Riddle, and causing him to crumble further; Harry closes the diary and stabs the cover with the Basilisk fang; Riddle screams in agony and disintegrates into yellow particles; shortly after Riddle's demise, Ginny awakens, hyperventilating, and sits up.]
Harry: Ginny.
Ginny: [turning to face him] Harry, it was me. But, I swear, I didn't mean to... Riddle made me. And... [notices Harry's injury] Harry... you're hurt.
Harry: [covering his wound] Don't worry. Ginny, you need to get yourself out. Follow the Chamber, and you'll find Ron. [Fawkes emits his song again; Harry and Ginny both look down the corridor to see him flying towards them; he swoops around the Basilisk's body, and lands in between them, then steps over to Harry] You were brilliant, Fawkes. I just wasn't quick enough. [Fawkes emits a soft grunt, then lowers his head to Harry's wound, and cries on it; the wound miraculously disappears; Ginny stares in amazement] Of course! [lifting his healed arm] Phoenix tears have healing powers. [Fawkes grunts affirmatively as Harry glances at him] Thanks. [looks at Ginny] It's all right, Ginny. It's over. It's just a memory.
[Fawkes then flies Lockhart, Ron, Harry, and Ginny out of the Chamber of Secrets.]
Lockhart: Amazing! This is just like magic!
[Fawkes carries the four of them up towards the opening of a cave as the moon can be seen above them.]
Out of the Hat
[Harry and Ron stand before Professor Dumbledore in his office, with Fawkes on his perch, and the sword and Sorting Hat resting on the desk.]
Professor Dumbledore: You both realize, of course, that in the past few hours, you have broken, perhaps, a dozen school rules.
Harry and Ron: Yes, sir.
Professor Dumbledore: And there is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled.
Harry and Ron: Yes, sir.
Professor Dumbledore: Therefore, it is only fitting... [Harry and Ron look up] that you both receive special awards for services to the school. [Harry and Ron look at each other with smiles, then back at Dumbledore again]
Ron: Thanks, sir.
Professor Dumbledore: [smiles at the boys, then stands up while handing some papers to Ron] And now, Mr. Weasley, if you would, have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban. I believe we... we want our gamekeeper back. [turns to Harry as Ron leaves the room] Harry... first, I want to thank you, Harry. You must've shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could've called Fawkes to you. And, second... I sense something is troubling you. Am I right, Harry?
Harry: You see, sir. I couldn't help but notice certain things... certain... certain similarities between... Tom Riddle and me.
Professor Dumbledore: I see. Well, you can speak Parseltongue, Harry. Why? Because, Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue. If I'm not mistaken, Harry, he transferred some of his powers to you the night he gave you that scar.
Harry: [amazed] Voldemort transferred some of his powers... to me?
Professor Dumbledore: Uh-huh. Not intentionally. But yes.
Harry: [as Dumbledore returns to his seat behind the desk] So, the Sorting Hat was right; I should be in Slytherin.
Professor Dumbledore: It's true, Harry. You possess many of the qualities that Voldemort himself prizes: Determination, resourcefulness, and if I may so, a certain disregard for the rules. Why then, did the Sorting Hat place you in Gryffindor?
Harry: [glancing at the Sorting Hat] Because I asked it to.
Professor Dumbledore: Exactly, Harry, exactly. Which makes you different from Voldemort. It is not our abilities that show what we truly are, it is our choices. If you want proof why you belong in Gryffindor, then I suggest you look more closely [picks up the sword] at this. [Harry takes the sword by the blade with his left hand, and its hilt with his right] Be careful.
Harry: [examines the sword and sees the name "Godric Gryffindor" on the Basilisk venom-coated blade] Godric Gryffindor.
Professor Dumbledore: Ah. It would take a true Gryffindor to pull that out of the hat. [Harry looks at Dumbledore]
Dobby's Reward
[The door to the office opens, Dumbledore glances past Harry, who turns around; Lucius Malfoy steps in to the office, standing behind him is Dobby.]
Harry: Dobby! So this is your master. The family you serve is the Malfoys. 
Dobby: [nervously looking at Harry] Mm-hmm. [fearfully glances up at Lucius]
Lucius: [through clenched teeth] I'll deal with you later. [Dobby cowers and whimpers; Lucius pulls out his walking stick and walks toward Dumbledore's desk, followed by Dobby; as he walks up the steps, he coldly uses the stick to push Harry aside] Out of my way, Potter. So... it's true. You have returned.
Professor Dumbledore: When the governors learned that Arthur Weasley's daughter was taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back.
Lucius: [angrily] Ridiculous!
Welcome Back
[It is the end of year feast; Nearly Headless Nick, now revitalized, floats along the row between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables in the Great Hall.]
Female Student: Welcome back, Sir Nicholas!
Nearly Headless Nick: Thank you.
Another Female Student: Good evening, Sir Nicholas.
Nearly Headless Nick: Good evening.
Male Student: Good to see you, Sir Nicholas.
Nearly Headless Nick: Thank you. [glancing at another pair of students] Hello. [reaching the doors to the Great Hall, he passes Filch, who is just happy to have Mrs. Norris back, and Hermione walks in as he turns toward her] Hermione! Welcome back.
Hermione: Thanks, Sir Nicholas. [Nearly Headless Nick floats away as Hermione glances at the Gryffindor table]
End Credits
[After the credits, a new book by Gilderoy Lockhart titled "Who Am I?" is shown in the window of Flourish and Blotts; on its cover is Lockhart wearing a straitjacket and a sling on his right arm and mumbling.]

Under Covers Prologue
[It is pitch black, until we see what seems to be a small glow before it dims out. Then, the glow emits again, only bigger and revealing itself to be from a window, and then dims out. During all the while, a dog was heard barking. The glow from the window emits again, only this time, a familiar object was in front of the glow and as it dims out. The glow emits again and the dims away, just as the object then shines, revealing itself to be the Warner Bros. Pictures shield, in silver and the byline fades in underneath. The scenery behind the shield fades in from the darkness and the glow emits again, revealing to be Privet Drive and the glow is coming from Harry's bedroom and 4 Privet Drive. We zoom through the shield and towards the window]

Harry: Lumos Maxima. [It was revealed that he is under the bed covers, and the glow is so bright that it lights up the room] Lumos Maxima [He casts the spell again which is the Lumos Maxima. Until he hears a toilet flushing and immediately goes back to sleep just as Vernon opens the door and turns on the light. He looks around in confusion before he turns off the light and closes the door and heads back to his bedroom. With him gone, Harry goes back to what he was doing.] Lumos Maxima [It revealed he was learning the Lumos Maxima from a book.] Lumos Maxima. Lumos Maxima! [The camera immediately zooms out from the covers, through the window where we see the film's title floating around in rays of light. We then zoom back into Harry's bedroom. As soon as Harry hears Vernon coming from his bedroom, he immediately returns to sleep just as Vernon opens the door and turns on the light. He looks around suspiciously just before he turns off the light and closes the door. Harry looks at the door and then smiles to himself before he really goes to sleep as we iris out.]
Aunt Marge's Big Mistake
[It is again pitch black. A doorbell ringing sound is heard multiple times]

Aunt Marge: Harry! Harry! Harry! Open the door.
[Cut from black to the foyer, where Harry opens the front door. It is raining outside and Aunt Marge exhales as she brings her umbrella down and gives it to Harry. She passes the foyer into the kitchen where Aunt Petunia stands waiting. Aunt Marge's pet bulldog Ripper is on a leash. Aunt Marge and Aunt Petunia exchange greetings as Ripper lifts up on his hind legs at Aunt Petunia. We then cut to Harry and Uncle Vernon in the foyer, where Harry unfolds a small parchment while Uncle Vernon takes off his car coat.]

Harry: Uncle Vernon, I need you to sign this form.
Uncle Vernon: What is it?
Harry: Nothing. School stuff.
Uncle Vernon: Later, perhaps, if you behave.
Harry: I will if she does.
Aunt Marge: Oh, you're still here, are you?
Harry: Yes.
Aunt Marge: Don't say 'yes' in that ungrateful way. [She hands Ripper's leash over to Petunia] Damn good of my brother to keep you. [She goes to Vernon to say something to him] He'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep, Vernon.
[Laughter is heard nearby. Hearing that, Aunt Marge looks delighted. She walks up to the couch, where the laughter has come from Harry's fat cousin Dudley, who is watching TV and eating snacks]]

Aunt Marge: Is that my Dudders? Is that my little neffy-pooh?

The Patronus
Seeing the Impossible
[Harry, Ron, and Hermione walk into the courtyard leading to the Covered Bridge]

Hermione: Beautiful day.
Ron: Gorgeous. Unless, of course, you’ve been ripped to pieces!
Harry: Ripped to pieces? What are you talking about?
Hermione: Ronald has lost his rat.
Ron: I haven’t lost anything! Your cat killed him!
Hermione: Rubbish.
Ron: Harry, you’ve seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers is always lurking about. And Scabbers is gone!
Hermione: Well, maybe you should learn to take better care of your pets! [Crookshanks climbs onto one of the stone walls behind them as they walk on to the Covered Bridge]
Ron: Your cat killed him!
Hermione: Did not!
Ron: Did.
Hermione: Didn’t.
[They meet up with Hagrid as he is skipping rocks at the lake.]

Hermione: How’d it go, Hagrid? The hearing?
Hagrid: Well, first off, the Committee members took turns talking about why we were there. [throws another rock bouncing across the lake] Then, I got up and did my piece. Said how Buckbeak was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers. And then, Lucius Malfoy got up. Well you can imagine, he said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature who would kill you as soon as look at you.
Hermione: [as Hagrid skips another rock] And then?
Hagrid: Then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius.
Ron: [obviously outraged] They’re not sacking you?!
Hagrid: No, I’m not sacked. [skips yet another rock, then speaks with his voice breaking] Buckbeak’s been sentenced to death!
[He furiously throws his last rock in the water with a loud splash and sniffles; behind him, Harry stands up, shocked by the sound of these words; he, Ron, and Hermione walk up to the water’s edge as Hagrid lets out a sad sigh.]

Professor Trelawney's Prediction
Witnesses To An Execution
[A scraping sound is heard, and a man is shown as he sits against the tree-like structure in the courtyard, with crows all around him. Harry, Ron, and Hermione step out, and see the man, Walden Macnair, sharpening a massive axe blade. He looks up at them as they approach; Hermione scowls at him as she walks past, obviously knowing that he intends to use it on Buckbeak. Macnair looks at Harry and grins maliciously as he continues sharpening his axe. Harry, Ron, and Hermione walk along the Covered Bridge, heading to Hagrid's cabin.]

Hermione: I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.
Ron: [as they reach the other end of the bridge] It just got worse. [they see Draco and his pals looking down at Hagrid’s house from the hilltop]
Draco: What did I tell you? Father said I can keep the hippogriff’s head. I think I’ll donate it to the Gryffindor’s common room. [enraged, Hermione quickly walks towards Draco] Oh, this is going to be rich.
Crabbe: [seeing Harry and his friends approaching] Look who’s here.
Draco: Ah, come to see the show? [happily holds out his arms]
Hermione: You! You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach! [points her wand at Malfoy’s throat in her rage]
Ron: Hermione, no! He’s not worth it. [Draco stands there whimpering as Hermione keeps her wand against his throat, then lowers it and turns away. Draco chuckles; next second, Hermione spins around and punches him in the face.]
Crabbe: [as he and the other boy help Draco to his feet] Malfoy, are you okay? Let’s go! Quick!
Draco: [as he and his friends run to the bridge] Not a word to anyone. Understood? I’m gonna get that jumped-up Mudblood! Mark my words!
Hermione: That felt good.
Ron: Not good. Brilliant.
[Hermione smiles with satisfaction. The three of them then head down the steps to Hagrid’s house, walking past Buckbeak, who’s chained up in the pumpkin patch, awaiting his approaching execution.]

Hagrid: [as he and Harry look out the window at Buckbeak] Oh, look at him. Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through ‘em.
Harry: Why don’t we just set him free?
Hagrid: [wishing he could, but knows that he can’t] They’d know it was me, and then Dumbledore would get into trouble. He’s coming down, you know, Dumbledore. Says he wants to be with me when they... when it happens. [walking away from the window] Great man, Dumbledore. Great man. [Hagrid’s flobberworm squeals; he throws it a piece of food, which it eats in one bite]
Hermione: We’ll stay with you, too, Hagrid.
Hagrid: You’ll do no such thing! [points at the window] Think I want you seeing something like that? No! You just drink your tea and be off. Oh. Before you do, Ron... [he picks up a plastic container and opens it and pulls Scabbers out]
Ron: [overjoyed to see his rat alive] Scabbers. You’re alive! [takes Scabbers from Hagrid]
Hagrid: You want to keep a closer eye on your pets, Ron.
Hermione: [as Ron turns around] I think that means you owe someone an apology.
Ron: Right. Next time I see Crookshanks, I’ll let him know.
Hermione: I meant me. [suddenly, the vase on the table breaks]
Hagrid: Blimey. What was that? [Hermione looks closely and finds a small rock with a snail shell pattern on it]
Harry: [a rock hits him in the back of the head] Ow. [he turns around and looks out the window] Hagrid. [beckoning Hagrid to the window]
Hagrid: [walking to the window and looking out] Oh, crikey. [Fudge, Dumbledore, and Macnair are walking towards Hagrid’s house, talking; Fudge glances at Buckbeak as he goes]
Dumbledore: No, Minister. Over this way.
Hagrid: [feeling very tense now] It’s late. It’s nearly dark. You shouldn’t be here. [going to his basket and grabbing a blanket] Someone sees you outside the castle this time of night, you’ll be in trouble. Big trouble, particularly you, Harry. [there is a knock at the door] With you in a moment. [throwing the blanket over his flobberworm] Quick. Quick! [Ron and Hermione head for the back door as Dumbledore knocks on the door again]
Harry: Hagrid. It’ll be fine. It’ll be okay.
Hagrid: [smiles slightly at Harry’s attempt to give him emotional support] Go on. Go on!
Dumbledore: [as Hermione opens the back door] That’s the ling you can see over there on the slope. [all three men have their backs turned, unaware that Harry and his friends are there; Hagrid opens the door to let them in] Ah, Hagrid.
Hagrid: Good evening, Professor Dumbledore. [Fudge graciously steps inside] Minister, just make your way through. Have a tea if you like.
Fudge: [obviously not thirsty] No, Hagrid. [Dumbledore and Macnair follow him inside] Gentlemen...
Dumbledore: [Harry, Ron, and Hermione race to the rear of the pumpkin patch] I’d like a cup of tea.
Fudge: [as Hagrid watches Harry, Ron, and Hermione leaving] Well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we? Very well. It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff known as Buckbeak, hereafter called “The Condemned”, shall be executed this day at sundown.
Hagrid: Dear, dear...
Dumbledore: Now, now, Hagrid. It’ll be all right.
Fudge: [as Harry, Ron, and Hermione continue eavesdropping from the pumpkin patch] The executioner shall dispatch the condemned by means of beheading. [Hermione hears a twig snap behind her and turns around]
Harry: What?
Hermione: I thought I just saw... Never mind.
Ron: Let’s go.
[As Harry, Ron, and Hermione run towards the steps leading back to the castle, Buckbeak suddenly looks up. Ron glances back at him as they go.]

Hagrid: Buckbeak didn’t mean no harm.
[Buckbeak lets out an uneasy bray as he watches the three teenagers running back to the castle. Harry takes a last look at Buckbeak before racing after Ron and Hermione up the castle stairs. From the hilltop, Ron, Hermione, and Harry look down at Hagrid’s house. Hagrid and Dumbledore are standing on the front steps of the house, Fudge is standing right in front of the steps, and Macnair faces them, standing just inches from the pumpkin patch. Dumbledore points at the pumpkin patch; as he turns to go inside the cabin, Macnair raises his axe and walks toward Buckbeak, hidden from view by the trees. Hagrid sadly takes a last look at his feathered friend, then turns to go inside his house. Harry, Ron, and Hermione watch with mounting tension; even Scabbers seems a little skittish. Hermione closes her eyes briefly and murmurs. She silently gasps as she sees Macnair lift his axe above his head, tilt it backwards, then bring it down with lightning speed. A chopping sound is heard; the execution has been carried out. The crows that have been hanging around Macnair fly away, squawking and cawing.]

End Credits Map
Harry: Lumos [His wand lighten up the screen, revealing the parchment] I solemnly swear as I'm up to no good. [The film title appears on the parchment when dark red ink soaks in, revealing to be the Marauder's Map. The map opens up and the first part of the credits roll with footprints going around the crew and cast's names. Afterwards, the rest of the credits continue as we scroll around the map in all sorts of directions, until we finally get to the last in credit notice "A P of A Productions Production"] Mischief managed. [The map closes and the film's title disappear as the red ink fades away from the map] Nox. [The light dims out from his wand. After about five seconds, a faint piano tune is heard before the "Distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures" logo fades in.]

Dudley Demented
The Advance Guard
Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place
The Order of the Phoenix
The Ministry of Magic
The Hearing
[A gavel is heard pounding as Harry sits in a chair in the middle of the room.]
Fudge: [sitting in an elevated seat, surrounded by numerous other wizards and witches; to his left is Ron's brother, Percy] "Disciplinary hearing of the 12th of August. Into offenses committed by Harry James Potter, resident at Number Four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey. Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister of Magic..."
Dumbledore: Witness for the defense: Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. [walks into the courtroom behind Harry]
Fudge: You got our message that the time and place of the hearing had been changed, did you? [smiles at Dumbledore with a slight laugh]
Dumbledore: I must've missed it. But, by a happy mistake, I arrived at the Ministry three hours early. [Fudge continues to look at him with a slight grin] The charges?
Fudge: [putting on his glasses] The charges against the accused are as follows: "That he did knowingly, and in full awareness of the illegality of his actions, produce a Patronus charm in the presence of a muggle." Do you deny producing said Patronus?
Harry: No, but...
Fudge: And you were aware that you were forbidden to use magic outside school while under the age of seventeen?
Harry: Yes, I was, but...
Fudge: Witches and wizards of the Wizengamot...
Harry: I was only doing it because of the Dementors! [the members of the Wizengamot all look surprised by the sound of this]
Madame Bones: Dementors? In Little Whinging?
The Originals
[Moody is walking along the walkway in King's Cross Station. A big black dog is walking alongside Harry, who is followed by the Weasleys and Hermione.]
Moody: [whispering as the dog walks past him and Tonks] Padfoot, are you barking mad? You'll blow the entire operation. [Sirius walks down the stairs, into a waiting room, and returns to his human form]
Harry: [running over and opening the door] Sirius, what are you doing here? If somebody sees you...
Sirius: I had to see you off, didn't I? [Harry smiles and approaches; Sirius puts his arm around his shoulder and they sit down] What's life without a little risk?
Harry: I don't want to see you get chucked back in Azkaban.
Luna Lovegood
[At Hogsmeade station, a student is shown looking at the Daily Prophet with a picture of Harry from the hearing on the front page with the headline changing from "Potter?" to "Plotter?" before getting up to disembark from the train. Harry, Ron, and Hermione walk along the train as Draco Malfoy and his cronies Crabbe and Goyle walk up behind them.]
Draco: I'm surprised the Ministry's still letting you walk around free, Potter. You better enjoy it while you can. I expect there's a cell in Azkaban with your name on it. [Harry furiously attempts to attack Malfoy, who backs away, as Ron restrains him; their three rivals walk off] What did I tell you? Complete nutter.
Harry: Just stay away from me!
Ron: It's only Malfoy. What did you expect?
Perfect, Prune, and Preserve
[At the Ravenclaw table, Luna, sitting across from Cho, is happily helping herself to a pastry. At the Gryffindor table, Seamus Finnigan, looks at Harry with what is clearly a look of hostility before turning away as Hermione helps herself to some of the food on the table.]
Dumbledore: Good evening, children. [everyone promptly gives him their attention] Now, we have two changes in staffing this year. First, we're pleased to welcome back Professor Grubbly-Plank, who will be taking Care of Magical Creatures while Professor Hagrid is temporary leave. We also wish to welcome our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher: Professor Dolores Umbridge. [Umbridge laughs] And I'm sure you'll all join me in wishing the Professor good luck.
Professor Umbridge’s Class
Detention with Dolores
Thestrals and Sympathy
The Hogwarts High Inquisitor
In the Hog’s Head
Hermione: [voiceover as Harry stands in the middle of the entrance hall] That foul, evil old gargoyle. [she walks around Ron as he sits on a sofa while Harry listens to the radio in the background] We're not learning how to defend ourselves. We're not learning how to pass our O.W.L.s. She's taking over the entire school.
Fudge: [on the radio as Ron looks disgusted by Umbridge's pointless lessons] Security has been, and will remain, the Ministry's top priority. [Harry turns up the volume] Furthermore, we have convincing evidence that these disappearances are the work of notorious mass murderer Sirius Black. [Harry looks at the radio in disbelief that Fudge is blaming anything Voldemort is behind on Sirius] Make no difference...
Sirius: Harry.
Harry: [glancing at the fireplace] Sirius. [runs over to the fireplace, where Sirius has just appeared in the form of flames]
Fudge: (cont.) We will hunt him down and find him...
Harry: [as Hermione walks over to the fireplace] What are you doing here?
Sirius: Answering your letter. You said you were worried about Umbridge. What's she doing, training you to kill half-breeds?
Harry: Sirius, she's not letting us use magic at all.
Sirius: Well, I'm not surprised. The latest intelligence is that Fudge doesn't want you trained in combat.
Ron: Combat? What does he think, we're forming some sort of wizard army?
Sirius: That's exactly what he thinks, that Dumbledore is assembling his own forces to take on the Ministry. He's becoming more paranoid by the minute. The others wouldn't want me telling you this, Harry. But things aren't going at all well with the Order. Fudge is blocking the truth at every turn. And these disappearances are just how it started before. Voldemort is on the move.
Harry: Well, what can we do?
Sirius: [hearing a door open] Someone's coming. I'm sorry I can't be of more help. But for now, at least, it looks like you're on your own. [Harry nods; the flames vanish; Harry, Ron, and Hermione walk to the window, looking out at the rain as a crash of lightning illuminates the common room]
Hermione: He really is out there, isn't he? [sighs] We've got to be able to defend ourselves. And if Umbridge refuses to teach us how, we need someone who will. [she turns toward Harry; Ron looks at him as well]
Dumbledore’s Army
Under the Mistletoe
Occlumency
The House of Black
Hagrid’s Tale
Unquiet Escape
[A lightning bolt crashes in the sky; in a cell in Azkaban, a Death Eater looks at the Dark Mark tattoo on his arm. Another Death Eater, Bellatrix Lestrange, licks her tattoo, then listens to hear an explosion, destroying a portion of the prison. Bellatrix walks through the corridor into the opening, and laughs maniacally now that she and her allies are free.]
Fudge: [as the Daily Prophet shows the headline "Mass Breakout From Azkaban"] We have confirmed that ten high-security prisoners in the early hours of yesterday evening did escape. [another section of the Daily Prophet reads "Ministry Angers Centaurs"] And of course, the Muggle Prime Minister has been alerted to the danger. We strongly suspect... [Fudge is shown walking with reporters] ...that the breakout was engineered by a man with personal experience in escaping from Azkaban: notorious mass murder Sirius Black... [subheadings reading "Sirius Black Manhunt Ordered" and "10,000 galleons on Black's head" are shown] ...cousin of escapee Bellatrix Lestrange. [Bellatrix is shown chained up in her cell, snarling and screaming; Neville puts down the Daily Prophet, looking very disturbed]
Hermione: [as she, Harry, and Ron walk into the Great Hall] Dumbledore warned Fudge this could happen. He's gonna get us all killed just because he can’t face the truth.
Seamus: [looks at Harry, Ron, and Hermione as they pass him and stands up] Harry. I, uh... I wanted to apologize. Now even me mum says the Prophet's version of things don’t add up. So... what I’m really trying to say is... I believe you.
Grawp
[Filch ascends the ladder to the very top as Harry, Ron, Hermione, and numerous other students watch. He hammers a spike into the wall, causing his ladder to tilt backward slightly, then puts up another Educational Decree. Harry, Ron, and Hermione look back at a student covering his head behind them. As he runs off, they look up at the new Educational Decree, which reads "Proclamation. Educational Decree No. 119: Dolores Jane Umbridge has replaced Albus Dumbledore as head of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry".]
Umbridge: [on the speakers] Boys and girls are not permitted to be within eight inches of each other. [the Grand Staircase is shown devoid of all its paintings] Those wishing to join the Inquistorial Squad for extra credit... Students will be submitted to questioning about suspected illicit activities... [Filch is stacking the empty portrait frames next to a door, then walks to collect the last one] ...any student in noncompliance will be expelled. [Filch stares at the painting, then takes it off the wall and tilts it slightly, causing the men in the painting to protest and attempt to keep their balance; he tilts it again, and then a third time, causing the men to go sliding out of sight while screaming; Filch grins with satisfaction, then carries the empty frame to the rest of the frames]
Snape’s Worst Memory
O.W.L.S
Out of the Fire
Fight and Flight
[Harry, Hermione, and Umbridge walk through the Forbidden Forest, clearly in the direction of where Grawp is being kept.]
Umbridge: How much further?
Hermione: Not far. It had to be somewhere where students wouldn't find it accidentally. [Umbridge stumbles over tree roots trying to keep up]
Harry: [whispering] What are you doing?
Hermione: [whispering back] Improvising.
The Department of Mysteries
[Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny, and Luna race through the Ministry atrium to the elevators, descending into the Department of Mysteries.]
Elevator: Department of Mysteries. [the door from Harry's dreams is straight ahead]
Harry: This is it. [the six of them approach the door; going through the door, they enter a dark corridor, filled with mysterious orbs]
Beyond the Veil
[A masked Death Eater approaches them.]
Harry: Where's Sirius?
Death Eater: You know, you really should learn to tell the difference between dreams... [draws his wand and uses it to remove his mask, revealing himself to be Lucius Malfoy] ...and reality. You saw only what the Dark Lord wanted you to see. Now hand me the Prophecy.
Harry: If you do anything to us, I'll break it.
Bellatrix: [laughing as she appears behind Lucius] He knows how to play. Itty...bitty...baby. Potter.
Neville: [recognizes her] Bellatrix Lestrange.
Bellatrix: Neville Longbottom, is it? How's mom and dad?
Neville: Better, now that they're about to be avenged. [points his wand at Bellatrix, shocking the others; Bellatrix points her wand at Neville]
Lucius: [holding up his hands] Now, let's everybody calm down... shall we? [Neville lowers his wand] All we want is that Prophecy.
Side By Side
Wizards Duel
Bellatrix: [in a taunting sing-song voice as Harry charges at her in the Aitrium] I killed Sirius Black. Ha ha ha! You coming to get me?
Harry: [points his wand at Bellatrix] Crucio! [Bellatrix screams and falls to the floor, whimpering in pain, then looks at Harry with a gasp as he points his wand at her, shaking with fury]
Voldemort: You've got to mean it, Harry. She killed him. She deserves it. You know the spell, Harry. [Voldemort himself appears out of thin air behind Harry; Bellatrix laughs at the sight of him] Do it. [Harry turns towards Voldemort and attempts to curse him, only for Voldemort to knock his wand out of his hand with a simple hand movement] So weak.
Dumbledore: [emerging from a fireplace and walking towards Voldemort] It was foolish of you to come here tonight, Tom. The Aurors are on their way.
Voldemort: By which time I shall be gone. And you... shall be dead.
[Voldemort aims a Killing Curse at Dumbledore, who counters with a Disarming Charm, knocking Harry aside while Bellatrix slides into a fireplace and disappears in green flames.]

Who's Harry Potter?
Horace Slughorn
What could be safer?
Snape's visitors
[It is raining at Spinner's End. Bellatrix Lestrange and Narcissa Malfoy, both wearing dark raincoats, walk around a corner, down an alley.]]
Bellatrix: Cissy! You can't do this! He can't be trusted!
Narcissa: The Dark Lord trusts him.
Bellatrix: The Dark Lord's mistaken! [Narcissa scoffs]
[They stop and stand up against the walls on either side as children ride by on their bikes, then continue on. Narcissa walks up to a house to her left and knocks on the door. Inside the house, someone is reading the Daily Prophet. As Bellatrix and Narcissa stand outside, Peter Pettigrew comes to the door and opens it. In the living room, Severus Snape lets his Daily Prophet drop and looks up.]
Snape: [putting the Daily Prophet down] Run along, Wormtail. [flicks his wand, shutting the door on Pettigrew]
Narcissa: [holding a glass of wine in her hand] I-I know I ought not to be here. The Dark Lord himself forbade me to speak of this. [behind her, Bellatrix walks around to the mantel and picks up a round object and examines it]
Snape: If the Dark Lord has forbidden it, you ought not to speak. [glances at Bellatrix] Put it down, Bella. We mustn't touch what isn't ours. [Bellatrix puts the round object back on the mantel] As it so happens, I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa.

Shell Cottage
[At the island where Albus Dumbledore's tomb is located, the stones guarding the tomb are magically moved aside, and Voldemort is shown taking the Elder Wand from the tomb; he examines it, then points it skyward, sending out a beam of electricity that illuminates the sky. The Warner Bros. logo then moves toward the screen. Cut to a foggy-looking Hogwarts, with Dementors all around. Severus Snape stands in the battlements, watching the students marching through the entry courtyard. The film's title is displayed, as the scene cuts to Harry kneeling down by Dobby's grave at Shell Cottage as he examines the piece of the mirror. Inside the cottage, Ron and Hermione are sitting at a table, as Luna walks up to a collection of shells.]
Luna: [extending her hand to the shells] It's beautiful here.
Bill: [as he and Fleur turn to her] It was out aunt's. We used to come here as kids. The Order uses it now as a safehouse. What's left of us, at least.
Luna: [as Harry walks away from the doorway behind her] Muggles think these keep evil away, but they're wrong.
Harry: I need to talk to the goblin.


Griphook's Price
He's After You
Gringotts
Coffing The Cup
Exit The Dragon
Final Hiding Place
Aberforth Dumbledore
[It is nighttime at Hogsmeade, with snow everywhere. In the distance, Hogwarts is lit up and visible. Harry, Ron, and Hermione apparate into the streets of the village. At that very second, an alarm that sounds like a cat screeching goes off. The three gaze at a nearby shop to see a door open, then run to hide.]
Death Eaters: They're here! Search everywhere. Look down by the stables! You two, come with me! Any sign? [the Death Eaters search under the tables, pulling up the tablecloths as Harry, Ron, and Hermione hide behind a nearby table, then hear the alarm again and walk off] Potter!
Hogwarts Reunion
Give Me Harry Potter
[The Hogwarts students are marching down from the Great Staircase, while they are being watched from above by the Carrows. The students are now standing in four blocks in the Great Hall, as Snape walks between them to the front of the Hall, accompanied by the Carrows.]
Snape: Many of you are surely wondering why I have summoned you at this hour. It has come to my attention that earlier this evening, Harry Potter was sighted in Hogsmeade. [some members of the crowd gasp] Now, should anyone, student or staff, attempt to aid Mr. Potter, they will be punished in a manner consistent with the severity of their transgression. [some of the other staff members, including Professor McGonagall and Horace Slughorn, look nervous] Furthermore, any person found to have knowledge of these events, who fails to come forward, will be treated as equally guilty. [the students stay silent] Now then. If anyone here has any knowledge of Mr. Potter's movements this evening, I invite them to step forward... now.
[Everyone in the hall stays absolutely silent. After a few seconds, footsteps are heard as Harry, who hid among the Gryffindor house students and wearing a Gryffindor robe, steps out into the open. All the students turn towards him in surprise. Even Snape looks surprised.]
Harry: It seems, that despite your exhaustive defensive strategies, you still have a bit of a security problem, headmaster. [the two entrance doors of the Great Hall open, and Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, Bill, Fleur, Remus Lupin, Nymphadora Tonks, Kingsley Shacklebolt, Neville, Dean, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley enter] And I'm afraid it's quite extensive. How dare you stand where he stood? Tell them how it happened that night! Tell them how you looked him in the eye, a man who trusted you, and killed him! Tell them!
[Snape hesitates a moment, then draws his wand and points it at Harry. Harry does the same, but is pushed aside by McGonagall, her wand pointed at Snape. Snape seems to draw back, but repoints his wand at McGonagall. The members of the Order have their wands at the ready as well. They burst into battle, McGonagall shooting flames at Snape, who does nothing but deflecting her attacks, while slowly moving backwards. He knocks over the Carrows with his defensive spell, then he morphs into a black cloud, flying out of the high window. McGonagall shouts after him.]
Professor McGonagall: COWARD! [She turns her back to the broken window and waves her wand twice to light the fires on the walls; the Great Hall is lit again as the students cheer while Harry removes his Gryffindor robe.]
Voldemort: [from within Harry’s mind] Harry...
Professor McGonagall: [as Harry slides down against the wall] Potter?
[The night sky ceiling of the Great Hall darkens, and a girl screams, causing Parvarti Patil to scream as well.]
Voldemort: [his voice amplified] I know that many of you will want to fight. Some of you may even think to fight is wise, but this is folly. Give me Harry Potter. Do this, and none shall be harmed. Give me Harry Potter, and I shall leave Hogwarts untouched. Give me Harry Potter, and you will be rewarded. You have one hour. [the ceiling brightens again]
Pansy Parkinson: What are you waiting for? [points at Harry] Someone grab him. [Ginny, Hermione, Ron, and some of the other students step in to defend Harry]
Filch: [running into the Great Hall, holding Mrs. Norris] Students out of bed! Students out of bed! Students in the corridor!
Professor McGonagall: They are supposed to be out of bed, you blithering idiot!
Filch: Oh. Sorry, ma’am.
Professor McGonagall: As it happens, Mr. Filch, your arrival is most opportune. If you would, I would like you, please, to lead Miss Parkinson and the rest of Slytherin House from the hall. [flicks her wand at the Great Hall entrance]
Filch: Exactly where is it I’ll be leading them to, ma’am?
Professor McGonagall: The dungeons would do. [the other students cheer]
Filch: Right. Right. Come on. Come!
Professor McGonagall: [approaches Harry as the Slytherin House students follow Filch] I presume you have a reason for returning, Potter. Just what is it you need?
Harry: Time, Professor, as much as you can get me.
Professor McGonagall: Do what you have to do. I’ll secure the castle. [Harry turns to leave the hall] Potter? [Harry turns around] It’s good to see you.
Harry: It’s good to see you too, Professor. [continues on his way while patting Neville] Hold the fort, Neville.
Duty To Our School
You Need Only Ask
Blow For Blow
Finding The Diadem
Fiendfyre
[As Harry gazes at the diadem, Draco, Blaise, and Goyle walk up to the empty portrait frames to his far right.]
Draco: Well, well. [Harry puts the diadem down and turns toward him; he and his pals each have their wands pointed at him] What brings you here, Potter?
Harry: [walks a few steps closer] I could ask you the same.
Draco: You have something of mine. I'd like it back.
Harry: [knowing Draco is referring to his purloined wand] Well, what's wrong with the one you have?
Draco: It's my mother's. It's powerful, but it's... not the same. Doesn't quite... understand me. Know what I mean?
Harry: Why didn't you tell her? Bellatrix? [Blaise looks at Draco in confusion, not understanding what Harry is talking about] You knew it was me. You didn't say anything.
Goyle: [leaning closer to Draco and whispering in his ear] Come on, Draco. Don't be a prat. Do him.
Draco: [as Harry reaches into his pocket] Easy. [the three prepare to attack]
Hermione: [she and Ron have just turned up] Expelliarmus! [Draco's mother's wand flies out of his hand, landing behind him; he proceeds to pick it up]
Goyle: Avada Kedavra! [Harry ducks while Ron and Hermione dodge]
Hermione: [using a table for cover] Stupefy! [her spell hits the table with the box containing the diadem, sending it flying into a mountain of furniture as Harry watches]
Ron: [furiously charging after Draco and his goons] That's my girlfriend, you numpties! [Hermione stares after Ron with a smile]
[Harry climbs the mountain of furniture, throwing chairs aside, looking for the diadem; Hermione climbs up to help him. While searching, Harry pulls out a Cornish Pixie, which struggles in his hand before he throws it aside; a whole bunch of them come flying out. Harry and Hermione then climb up on to an armchair and search through the massive couch.]
Harry: [finding the diadem among the furniture around the couch] Got it! [holds up the diadem; he and Hermione then hear what sounds like an explosion coming from the direction Draco, his goons, and Ron went; they look in that direction, then climb down from the furniture mountain, still looking in that direction]
Ron: Run! [the bookshelf and objects beyond the empty portrait frames illuminate with an orange-yellowish light, not a good sign] Run! [he comes sprinting around the bookshelf, screaming in panic as the roaring and whooshing sound of flames is heard; he grabs Hermione's hand and pulls her along behind him as he runs while Harry glances at them] Goyle's setting the bloody place on fire!
[Harry looks back just in time to see a huge fiery snake slithering around the empty frames and come toward him while opening its mouth. For a split second, Harry stands there with his mouth agape in horror, then turns and races after Ron and Hermione. As the three turn a corner, massive flames come at them from both sides. Harry casts spells, knocking down chairs, trying to slow down the flames, to no avail. The flames take the form of a massive bird, sending burning chairs and other objects flying. Meanwhile, Draco and Blaise back away in horror as Goyle's wand keeps producing more flames, beyond his control; as Draco and Blaise begin to climb a mountain of furniture, Goyle throws his wand away. Ron and Hermione are fleeing from a giant fiery lion, while Harry is fleeing from a giant fiery serpent. In their section, Draco, Blaise, and Goyle are desperately climbing the furniture mountain. Reuniting with each other, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are cornered by a giant flaming bird; running the other way, a huge fiery tiger comes toward them; trying to find another route, a massive snake of fire comes at them, though Harry stops it by conjuring a barrier of water. Falling to the floor, Ron glances at a bunch of broomsticks and throws one to Harry. Seconds later, Harry, Ron, and Hermione take to the air on the broomsticks, flying over the flames. Goyle continues following Draco and Blaise up the mountain of furniture; grabbing a chair, he pulls it loose and loses his balance, falling down and getting swallowed up by the flames. Draco looks down at where Goyle fell, devastated by his friend's death, then he and Blaise continue climbing to the top, desperate to avoid the same demise.]
Ron: Come on, this way!
[As they go, Harry, still holding the diadem, flies past Draco and Blaise, both standing on a table at the top of the furniture mountain. Suddenly, the books under the table fall, causing it to tilt; Draco and Blaise quickly grab hold of the table.]
Harry: [glancing back at Draco and Blaise and seeing they're in trouble] We can't leave them! [flies back to help them]
Ron: [glancing at Hermione, hardly believing that Harry is going out of his way to help their enemies] He's joking, right? [he and Hermione turn around and follow Harry; Harry extends his hand to grab Draco's hand, but misses; Draco nervously looks down at the flames below; Harry rejoins Ron and Hermione] If we die for them, Harry, I'm gonna kill you! [Harry quickly flies back to the table, grabbing Draco and pulling him onto his broom while Ron takes Blaise, just as the flames engulf the table]
[Hermione takes the lead as she, Harry, Ron, Draco, and Blaise fly over the flames as burning chairs fall down everywhere, looking for the exit. Hermione eventually spots a wall of flames up ahead, and knows the door is just past it. She casts a spell at the flames, making an opening which the five of them rocket through. Landing safely in the corridor as a fireball emits from the door to the Room of Requirement, Draco gets to his feet and flees the scene. Harry glances at him, then turns his attention to the diadem, in the middle of the corridor.]
Hermione: [throwing a Basilisk fang to Harry] Harry! [Harry reaches up and catches the fang in midair, and then, without hesistation, stabs the diadem with it, and he recoils as the ruptured diadem emits black smoke. Ron then kicks the diadem back into the Room of Requirement, into the flames; three fiery visages of Voldemort appear among the flames, which come roaring towards the door as Ron and Hermione back away. The doors close just as the flames are about to come through.]
[From the hilltop overlooking the castle, Nagini recoils while Voldemort shudders due to the diadem's destruction. In the castle, Harry sits next to a post, shaking for the same reason. Recovering from his "seizure", Voldemort turns and walks away as Pius Thicknesse and a few other Death Eaters approach him.]
Pius Thicknesse: My Lord?
Voldemort: [pointing the Elder Wand at Pius] Avada Kedavra! [Pius gasps as the lethal blast hits him and falls backwards into the arms of the Death Eaters around him, who look at Voldemort in shock, as he continues walking along, then glances at Nagini, following closely behind him] Come, Nagini. I need to keep you safe. [he and Nagini disapparate]

The Wand's Choice
[In the battlements, Voldemort slams Harry against the wall and viciously slaps and kicks him before grabbing him by the neck and throwing him down.]
Harry: You were right. [Voldemort slaps Harry again] When you told Professor Snape that wand was failing you, it will always fail you.
Voldemort: [furiously aiming a curse at Harry, forcing him dangerously close to the edge of the battlements] I killed Snape!
Harry: [as Voldemort walks up to him] But what if the wand never belonged to Snape? What if its allegiance was always to someone else? Come on, Tom. Let's finish this the way we started it... [grabs Voldemort around the back of his neck, causing him to grit his teeth and glare at him] together!
[Harry throws both himself and Voldemort off the battlements; after a brief free-fall, the two go flying around the castle, ultimately crash-landing in the entry courtyard. Voldemort and Harry crawl for their respective wands, grabbing them at the same time, then get to their knees. Voldemort aims a killing curse at Harry, who responds with Expelliarmus. In the castle, Nagini is slithering after Ron and Hermione as they run down the stairs. While Harry and Voldemort are still locked in battle, Ron turns and aims a killing curse at Nagini, to no effect. Nagini lunges at Ron and Hermione as they crouch in the massive pile of rubble. Neville appears just in time and swings the sword at Nagini, decapitating her and causing her to disintegrate into black smoke. Ron and Hermione cringe. The destruction of his final Horcrux causes Voldemort to break off his attack. The black smoke forms numerous visages of Voldemort. Voldemort expresses grief over Nagini's death, and then realizes he has no more Horcruxes left and is now vulnerable. Harry turns toward Voldemort again. Voldemort aims a final killing curse at Harry, who responds with Expelliarmus again. This time, Harry pushes Voldemort's killing curse back at him; green light seeps through the cracks in the Elder Wand, causing Voldemort's arm to slowly turn black. The beam of green light recedes into the wand; Harry's disarming charm causes the Elder Wand to fly out of Voldemort's hand, through the air, straight towards Harry, who reaches up and catches it, then glances back at his nemesis. Voldemort, turning black and gray all over, slowly begins to crumble. Harry grins as he watches Voldemort crumbling. Voldemort screams as he crumbles more rapidly and looks into the sky as he disintegrates from head to toe. Voldemort's remains then blow away and vanish.]
The Wizard's Choice
[In the Great Hall, students and staff alike are recuperating from the battle and also celebrating their victory. Neville sits on one of the benches holding the Sorting Hat and sword as Luna steps up behind him and sits down next to him and they exchange grins. Harry walks around smiling at the Weasleys as well as Cho and her friends.] 
Aberforth: [as he, Seamus, and Dean talk and laugh] I always figured he was a big fellow.
Professor Slughorn: I couldn't find my wand. I never lost my wand in my entire life. It was lost in the folds of my gowns. I managed to find it and I dispatched a few...
Hagrid: [as Harry walks up to him, holding both Draco's wand and the Elder Wand] Harry... [he chuckles and they embrace, then turns and walks back to the castle's front doors]
[Filch picks a piece of rubble from the big pile then casually throws it aside and begins sweeping the mess. Ron and Hermione then walk into the Great Hall, and they and Harry share smiles. Minutes later, the three of them are walking along the Viaduct bridge. Harry steps up onto one of the sides of the bridge, and examines the Elder Wand.]
Hermione: Why didn't it work for him, the Elder Wand?
Harry: [glancing at her and Ron] It answered to somebody else. When he killed Snape, he thought the wand would become his. But, the thing is, the wand never belonged to Snape. It was Draco who disarmed Dumbledore that night on the Astronomy Tower. From that moment on, the wand answered to him, until... the other night, when I disarmed Draco, at Malfoy Manor.
Ron: So, that means... [Hermione glances at him]
Harry: [holding the wand closely] It's mine.
Ron: What should we do with it?
Hermione: "We"?
Ron: I'm just saying, that's the Elder Wand, the most powerful wand in the world. With that, we'd be invincible.
[Harry knows that Ron is making a good point, but also knows that the Elder Wand has caused more trouble than good. He grips the Elder Wand with both his hands. Ron and Hermione glance at each other, then back at Harry as he snaps the Elder Wand in two, then throws the pieces into the ravine, much to their shock. After a few seconds, Harry steps down onto the bridge and walks away as Ron and Hermione watch him. Harry glances down the bridge, then cranes his neck back at his friends. Hermione walks up to him with a smile, then takes his hand; Ron steps up as well and takes Hermione's hand. The three friends gaze into the distance, wondering what the future will have in store for them now that their ongoing saga with Voldemort is finally over.]
19 Years Later
[The words "19 years later" appear on the screen, which brightens to show King's Cross Station in the year 2017. Harry and Ginny are walking towards the gateway to Platform 9¾ with their children, James Sirius Potter, Lily Luna Potter, and Albus Severus Potter. Lily gets off James' trunk, and he runs right through the barrier.]
